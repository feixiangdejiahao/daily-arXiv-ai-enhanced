Since program synthesis is essentially a combinatorial search, the\ncommunity has sought to leverage powerful combinatorial constraint solvers.\nHere, constraints are used to express the program semantics, but not as a\npotentially potent tool to remove unwanted programs. Recent inductive logic\nprogramming approaches introduce constraints on the program's syntax to be\nsynthesized. These syntactic constraints allow for checking and propagating a\nconstraint without executing the program, and thus for arbitrary operators. In\nthis work, we leverage syntactic constraints to model program spaces, defining\nnot just solutions that are feasible, but also ones that are likely useful. To\ndemonstrate this idea, we introduce BART, a solver that efficiently propagates\nand solves these constraints. We evaluate BART on program space enumeration\ntasks, finding that the constraints eliminate up to 99 percent of the program\nspace, and that modeling program spaces significantly reduces enumeration time."}

For value-flow analysis, the engine is the\nbest-in-class Datalog evaluator (often by a factor of over 20x in execution\ntime); for applications that require full SMT (e.g., a concolic execution\nengine or other symbolic evaluator that needs to solve arbitrarily complex\nconditions), the engine is leveraging the leading SMT solvers; for lightweight\nsymbolic evaluation (e.g., solving simple conditionals in the context of a\npath-sensitive analysis), the engine can use Datalog-native symbolic reasoning,\nachieving large speedups (often of over 2x) compared to eagerly appealing to an\nSMT solver."}

Objective: Understand what\npower-related phenomena occur in pair programming as it is used in industry;\ngive advice to practitioners on how to do better pair programming.

Run a\nsurvey with 292 participants about that theory. Use it to demonstrate that the\nphenomena are common. Results: Our theory describes the phenomenon of Power\nGap: a perceived difference in participation opportunities. The theory shows\nthe behaviors that create a Power Gap or result from it. Power Gaps tend to\ndamage knowledge transfer, code quality, and process effi ciency. The survey\nresults show that all concepts from our theory are frequent in practice.

Despite their individual successes in numerous\napplication fields, the two approaches have remained largely separate; an\nartifact of the simple reality that there is no broadly adopted unifying\nplatform for effortless and efficient integration of symbolic techniques with\nhigh-performance data-flow reasoning.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce Desyan: a platform for writing program\nanalyses with seamless integration of value-flow and symbolic reasoning. Desyan\nexpands a production-ready Datalog fixpoint engine (Souffl\\'e) with\nfull-fledged SMT solving invoking industry-leading SMT engines. Desyan provides\nconstructs for automatically (and efficiently!) handling typical patterns that\ncome up in program analysis. At the same time, the integration is agnostic with\nrespect to the solving technology, and supports Datalog-native symbolic\nreasoning, via a bottom-up algebraic reasoning module.\n  The result is an engine that allows blending different kinds of reasoning, as\nneeded for the underlying analysis. For value-flow analysis, the engine is the\nbest-in-class Datalog evaluator (often by a factor of over 20x in execution\ntime); for applications that require full SMT (e.g., a concolic execution\nengine or other symbolic evaluator that needs to solve arbitrarily complex\nconditions), the engine is leveraging the leading SMT solvers; for lightweight\nsymbolic evaluation (e.g., solving simple conditionals in the context of a\npath-sensitive analysis), the engine can use Datalog-native symbolic reasoning,\nachieving large speedups (often of over 2x) compared to eagerly appealing to an\nSMT solver."}

With the development of deep learning\ntechnologies, adopting pre-trained models for this task has become mainstream.\nConsidering the retrieval efficiency, most of the previous approaches adopt a\ndual-encoder for this task, which encodes the description and code snippet into\nrepresentation vectors, respectively. However, the model structure of the\ndual-encoder tends to limit the model's performance, since it lacks the\ninteraction between the code snippet and description at the bottom layer of the\nmodel during training. To improve the model's effectiveness while preserving\nits efficiency, we propose a framework, which adopts Self-AdaPtive Model\nDistillation for Efficient CodE Retrieval, named SPENCER. SPENCER first adopts\nthe dual-encoder to narrow the search space and then adopts the cross-encoder\nto improve accuracy. To improve the efficiency of SPENCER, we propose a novel\nmodel distillation technique, which can greatly reduce the inference time of\nthe dual-encoder while maintaining the overall performance. We also propose a\nteaching assistant selection strategy for our model distillation, which can\nadaptively select the suitable teaching assistant models for different\npre-trained models during the model distillation to ensure the model\nperformance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the combination of\ndual-encoder and cross-encoder improves overall performance compared to solely\ndual-encoder-based models for code retrieval. Besides, our model distillation\ntechnique retains over 98% of the overall performance while reducing the\ninference time of the dual-encoder by 70%."}

An Empirical Study on a One-billion-user Online Service System", "comment": "Accepted by the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical\n  Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025)", "summary": "Background: It has long been suggested that user feedback, typically written\nin natural language by end-users, can help issue detection. However, for\nlarge-scale online service systems that receive a tremendous amount of\nfeedback, it remains a challenging task to identify severe issues from user\nfeedback. Aims: To develop a better feedback-based issue detection approach, it\nis crucial first to gain a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics\nof user feedback in real production systems. Method: In this paper, we conduct\nan empirical study on 50,378,766 user feedback items from six real-world\nservices in a one-billion-user online service system. We first study what users\nprovide in their feedback. We then examine whether certain features of feedback\nitems can be good indicators of severe issues. Finally, we investigate whether\nadopting machine learning techniques to analyze user feedback is reasonable.\nResults: Our results show that a large proportion of user feedback provides\nirrelevant information about system issues. As a result, it is crucial to\nfilter out issue-irrelevant information when processing user feedback.\nMoreover, we find severe issues that cannot be easily detected based solely on\nuser feedback characteristics. Finally, we find that the distributions of the\nfeedback topics in different time intervals are similar. This confirms that\ndesigning machine learning-based approaches is a viable direction for better\nanalyzing user feedback. Conclusions: We consider that our findings can serve\nas an empirical foundation for feedback-based issue detection in large-scale\nservice systems, which sheds light on the design and implementation of\npractical issue detection approaches."}

With the\ngrowing use of Large Language Models (LLM) as AI modeling assistants, more\nautomation will be involved in generating diagrams. This necessitates the\nadvancement of automatic model correctness evaluation tools. Such a tool can be\nused to evaluate both manually and AI automatically generated models; to\nprovide feedback to system engineers, and enable AI assistants to self-evaluate\nand self-enhance their generated models.\n  In this paper, we propose MCeT, the first fully automated tool to evaluate\nthe correctness of a behavioral model, sequence diagrams in particular, against\nits corresponding requirements text and produce a list of issues that the model\nhas. We utilize LLMs for the correctness evaluation tasks as they have shown\noutstanding natural language understanding ability. However, we show that\ndirectly asking an LLM to compare a diagram to requirements finds less than 35%\nof issues that experienced engineers can find. We propose to supplement the\ndirect check with a fine-grained, multi-perspective approach; we split the\ndiagram into atomic, non-divisible interactions, and split the requirements\ntext into atomic, self-contained items. We compare the diagram with atomic\nrequirements and each diagram-atom with the requirements. We also propose a\nself-consistency checking approach that combines perspectives to mitigate LLM\nhallucinated issues. Our combined approach improves upon the precision of the\ndirect approach from 0.58 to 0.81 in a dataset of real requirements. Moreover,\nthe approach finds 90% more issues that the experienced engineers found than\nthe direct approach, and reports an average of 6 new issues per diagram."}

Despite the widespread use of\nthis technology, it remains unclear how well LLMs generate code solutions in\nterms of software quality and how they compare to human-written code. Aims:\nThis study compares the internal quality attributes of LLM-generated and\nhuman-written code. Method: Our empirical study integrates datasets of coding\ntasks, three LLM configurations (zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning), and\nSonarQube to assess software quality. The dataset comprises Python code\nsolutions across three difficulty levels: introductory, interview, and\ncompetition. We analyzed key code quality metrics, including maintainability\nand reliability, and the estimated effort required to resolve code issues.\nResults: Our analysis shows that LLM-generated code has fewer bugs and requires\nless effort to fix them overall. Interestingly, fine-tuned models reduced the\nprevalence of high-severity issues, such as blocker and critical bugs, and\nshifted them to lower-severity categories, but decreased the model's\nperformance. In competition-level problems, the LLM solutions sometimes\nintroduce structural issues that are not present in human-written code.\nConclusion: Our findings provide valuable insights into the quality of\nLLM-generated code; however, the introduction of critical issues in more\ncomplex scenarios highlights the need for a systematic evaluation and\nvalidation of LLM solutions.
