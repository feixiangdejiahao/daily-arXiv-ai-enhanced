However, manually writing annotations can be time-consuming and\ntedious. The result is that most real-world Python code remains largely\nuntyped. Past approaches to annotating types in Python code fall short in a\nnumber of ways. Static approaches struggle with dynamic features and infer\noverly broad types. AI-based methods are inherently unsound and can miss rare\nor user-defined types. Dynamic methods can impose extreme runtime overheads,\ndegrading performance by up to 270x, abort execution as they exhaust resources,\nand even infer incorrect types that lead to runtime errors. Crucially, all\nprior work assumes implicitly that the code to be annotated is already correct.\nThis assumption is generally unwarranted, especially for large codebases that\nhave been untyped.\n  This paper presents RightTyper, a novel approach for Python that overcomes\nthese disadvantages. RightTyper not only generates precise type annotations\nbased on actual program behavior, improving recall in type checking relative to\nprior approaches.

IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "summary": "Large Language Models have been recently exploited as judges for complex\nnatural language processing tasks, such as Q&A. The basic idea is to delegate\nto an LLM the assessment of the \"quality\" of the output provided by an\nautomated technique for tasks for which: (i) quantitative metrics would only\ntell part of the story, and; (ii) a large-scale human-based evaluation would be\ntoo expensive. LLMs-as-a-judge, if proven effective for a specific task, can\nalso unlock new possibilities for automation, with several LLMs proposing a\nsolution for a given instance of the task and others judging and deciding what\nis the best output to show the user. We study the effectiveness of\nLLMs-as-a-judge for two code-related tasks, namely code generation and code\nsummarization. The rationale for choosing these tasks is two-fold. First,\nquantitative metrics are usually not enough for the assessment of code\nsummarizers/generators. For example, it is well documented that metrics such as\nBLEU are quite weak proxies for the quality of the generated summaries. Second,\neven state-of-the-art techniques still struggle with handling complex instances\nof these tasks, making them good candidates for benefiting from more advanced\nsolutions envisioning collaboration among LLMs. For code generation, we check\nwhether eight LLMs are able to judge the correctness of 1,405 Java methods and\n1,281 Python functions generated by the same LLMs or implemented by humans.

To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been\nproposed to reduce the unreliability (i.e., hallucinations) of LLMs. However,\ndesigning effective pipelines remains challenging due to numerous design\nchoices. In this paper, we construct a retrieval corpus of over 3 million Java\nand Python related Stack Overflow posts with accepted answers, and explore\nvarious RAG pipeline designs to answer developer questions, evaluating their\neffectiveness in generating accurate and reliable responses. More specifically,\nwe (1) design and evaluate 7 different RAG pipelines and 63 pipeline variants\nto answer questions that have historically similar matches, and (2) address new\nquestions without any close prior matches by automatically lowering the\nsimilarity threshold during retrieval, thereby increasing the chance of finding\npartially relevant context and improving coverage for unseen cases. We find\nthat implementing a RAG pipeline combining hypothetical-documentation-embedding\n(HyDE) with the full-answer context performs best in retrieving and answering\nsimilarcontent for Stack Overflow questions. Finally, we apply our optimal RAG\npipeline to 4 open-source LLMs and compare the results to their zero-shot\nperformance. Our findings show that RAG with our optimal RAG pipeline\nconsistently outperforms zero-shot baselines across models, achieving higher\nscores for helpfulness, correctness, and detail with LLM-as-a-judge. These\nfindings demonstrate that our optimal RAG pipelines robustly enhance answer\nquality for a wide range of developer queries including both previously seen\nand novel questions across different LLMs"}

However,\ntraditional optimization methods often rely on manual tuning and heuristics,\nwhich can be time-consuming and error-prone. Recent studies proposed to\nleverage Large Language Models(LLMs) to assist in RTL code optimization. LLMs\ncan generate optimized code snippets based on natural language descriptions,\npotentially speeding up the optimization process. However, existing approaches\nhave not thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of LLM-Based code optimization\nmethods for RTL code with complex timing logic. To address this gap, we\nconducted a comprehensive empirical investigation to assess the capability of\nLLM-Based RTL code optimization methods in handling RTL code with complex\ntiming logic. In this study, we first propose a new benchmark for RTL\noptimization evaluation. It comprises four subsets, each corresponding to a\nspecific area of RTL code optimization. Then we introduce a method based on\nmetamorphosis to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Based RTL\ncode optimization methods.Our key insight is that the optimization\neffectiveness should remain consistent for semantically equivalent but more\ncomplex code. After intensive experiments, we revealed several key findings.\n(1) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods can effectively optimize logic\noperations and outperform existing compiler-based methods. (2) LLM-Based RTL\noptimization methods do not perform better than existing compiler-based methods\non RTL code with complex timing logic, particularly in timing control flow\noptimization and clock domain optimization. This is primarily attributed to the\nchallenges LLMs face in understanding timing logic in RTL code. Based on these\nfindings, we provide insights for further research in leveraging LLMs for RTL\ncode optimization."}

Berger"], "title": "RightTyper: Effective and Efficient Type Annotation for Python", "comment": null, "summary": "Python type annotations bring the benefits of static type checking to the\nlanguage. However, manually writing annotations can be time-consuming and\ntedious. The result is that most real-world Python code remains largely\nuntyped. Past approaches to annotating types in Python code fall short in a\nnumber of ways. Static approaches struggle with dynamic features and infer\noverly broad types. AI-based methods are inherently unsound and can miss rare\nor user-defined types. Dynamic methods can impose extreme runtime overheads,\ndegrading performance by up to 270x, abort execution as they exhaust resources,\nand even infer incorrect types that lead to runtime errors. Crucially, all\nprior work assumes implicitly that the code to be annotated is already correct.\nThis assumption is generally unwarranted, especially for large codebases that\nhave been untyped.\n  This paper presents RightTyper, a novel approach for Python that overcomes\nthese disadvantages. RightTyper not only generates precise type annotations\nbased on actual program behavior, improving recall in type checking relative to\nprior approaches. It also turns type checking into anomaly detection, allowing\nthe type checker to identify corner cases that the programmer can audit for\nunintended behavior. RightTyper is also fast and space-efficient, imposing just\n30% performance overhead on average. RightTyper achieves these characteristics\nby a principled yet pervasive use of sampling--guided by self-profiling--along\nwith statistical filtering and careful resolution and aggregation of type\ninformation."}
