These kinds\nof models are typically evaluated through task success rates, which fail to\ncapture the quality of task execution and the mode's confidence in its\ndecisions. In this paper, we propose eight uncertainty metrics and five quality\nmetrics specifically designed for VLA models for robotic manipulation tasks. We\nassess their effectiveness through a large-scale empirical study involving 908\nsuccessful task executions from three state-of-the-art VLA models across four\nrepresentative robotic manipulation tasks. Human domain experts manually\nlabeled task quality, allowing us to analyze the correlation between our\nproposed metrics and expert judgments. The results reveal that several metrics\nshow moderate to strong correlation with human assessments, highlighting their\nutility for evaluating task quality and model confidence. Furthermore, we found\nthat some of the metrics can discriminate between high-, medium-, and\nlow-quality executions from unsuccessful tasks, which can be interesting when\ntest oracles are not available.
