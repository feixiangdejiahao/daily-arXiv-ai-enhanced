As a general rule, CodeLLMs are trained by dividing training\nexamples into input tokens and then learn importance of those tokens in a\nprocess called machine attention. Machine attention is based solely on input\ntoken salience to output token examples during training. Human software\ndevelopers are different, as humans intuitively know that some tokens are more\nsalient than others. While intuition itself is ineffable and a subject of\nphilosophy, clues about salience are present in human visual attention, since\npeople tend to look at more salient words more often. In this paper, we present\nEyeMulator, a technique for training CodeLLMs to mimic human visual attention\nwhile training for various software development tasks.

However, information useful for\ndocumentation is observed to be scattered across various artifacts that\nco-evolve with the source code. Leveraging this information across multiple\nartifacts can reduce the effort involved in maintaining documentation. Hence,\nwe propose DocFetch, to generate different types of documentation from multiple\nsoftware artifacts. We employ a multi-layer prompt based LLM and generate\nstructured documentation corresponding to different documentation types for the\ndata consolidated in DocMine dataset. We evaluate the performance of DocFetch\nusing a manually curated groundtruth dataset by analysing the artifacts in\nDocMine. The evaluation yields a highest BLEU-4 score of 43.24% and ROUGE-L\nscore of 0.39 for generation of api-related and file-related information from\nfive documentation sources. The generation of other documentation type related\ninformation also reported BLEU-4 scores close to 30% indicating good\nperformance of the approach. Thus,DocFetch can be employed to\nsemi-automatically generate documentation, and helps in comprehending the\nprojects with minimal effort in maintaining the documentation."}

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs)\nhave improved code translation quality, existing approaches face significant\nchallenges in practical scenarios: insufficient contextual understanding,\ninflexible prompt designs, and inadequate error correction mechanisms. These\nlimitations severely hinder accurate and efficient translation of complex,\nreal-world code repositories. To address these challenges, we propose\nRepoTransAgent, a novel multi-agent LLM framework for repository-aware code\ntranslation. RepoTransAgent systematically decomposes the translation process\ninto specialized subtasks-context retrieval, dynamic prompt construction, and\niterative code refinement-each handled by dedicated agents. Our approach\nleverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for contextual information\ngathering, employs adaptive prompts tailored to varying repository scenarios,\nand introduces a reflection-based mechanism for systematic error correction. We\nevaluate RepoTransAgent on hundreds of Java-C# translation pairs from six\npopular open-source projects. Experimental results demonstrate that\nRepoTransAgent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both\ncompile and pass rates. Specifically, RepoTransAgent achieves up to 55.34%\ncompile rate and 45.84% pass rate. Comprehensive analysis confirms the\nrobustness and generalizability of RepoTransAgent across different LLMs,\nestablishing its effectiveness for real-world repository-aware code\ntranslation."}

The modelSolver focuses on power flow and state\nestimation using an open-box approach, which allows users to specify custom\nmodels using either real or complex variables. Unlike existing tools that rely\non hard-coded models, modelSolver enables the representation of a wide range of\nadvanced functionalities, including power flow with voltage regulators and load\ntap changers, continuation power flow, and Gauss-Newton state estimation with\nequality constraints. Compatibility with MATPOWER is ensured via a converter\nthat automates importing data files.

Artificial Intelligence systems are mainly\nimplemented as software solutions, and it is essential to discover and remove\nsoftware defects to assure its quality using defect analysis which is one of\nthe major activities that contribute to software quality. Despite the\nproliferation of AI-based systems, current defect analysis models fail to\ncapture their unique attributes. This paper proposes a framework inspired by\nthe Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) paradigm and enables defect analysis\nof Artificial Intelligence systems while recognizing its special attributes and\ncharacteristics. This study demonstrated the feasibility of modifying ODC for\nAI systems to classify its defects. The ODC was adjusted to accommodate the\nData, Learning, and Thinking aspects of AI systems which are newly introduced\nclassification dimensions. This adjustment involved the introduction of an\nadditional attribute to the ODC attributes, the incorporation of a new severity\nlevel, and the substitution of impact areas with characteristics pertinent to\nAI systems. The framework was showcased by applying it to a publicly available\nMachine Learning bug dataset, with results analyzed through one-way and two-way\nanalysis. The case study indicated that defects occurring during the Learning\nphase were the most prevalent and were significantly linked to high-severity\nclassifications. In contrast, defects identified in the Thinking phase had a\ndisproportionate effect on trustworthiness and accuracy. These findings\nillustrate AIODC's capability to identify high-risk defect categories and\ninform focused quality assurance measures."}

A\ncore requirement for an effective DT is to act as a fast, accurate, and\nmaintainable surrogate of its physical counterpart, the physical twin (PT). To\nthis end, machine learning (ML) is frequently employed to (i) construct\nreal-time DT prototypes using efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) derived\nfrom high-fidelity simulations of the PT's nominal behavior, and (ii)\nspecialize these prototypes into DT instances by leveraging historical sensor\ndata from the target PT. Despite the broad applicability of ML, its use in DT\nengineering remains largely ad hoc. Indeed, while conventional ML pipelines\noften train a single model for a specific task, DTs typically require multiple,\ntask- and domain-dependent models. Thus, a more structured approach is required\nto design DTs.\n  In this paper, we introduce DesCartes Builder, an open-source tool to enable\nthe systematic engineering of ML-based pipelines for real-time DT prototypes\nand DT instances. The tool leverages an open and flexible visual data flow\nparadigm to facilitate the specification, composition, and reuse of ML models.\nIt also integrates a library of parameterizable core operations and ML\nalgorithms tailored for DT design. We demonstrate the effectiveness and\nusability of DesCartes Builder through a civil engineering use case involving\nthe design of a real-time DT prototype to predict the plastic strain of a\nstructure."}

Despite\nits importance, little is known about how variable code is distributed among\ndevelopers or whether conventional expertise metrics adequately capture\nvariable code proficiency.

We mined\nrepositories of 25 CSS projects, analyzing 450,255 commits from 9,678\ndevelopers.

As such, we propose\nthe investigation of a new research line on AI-powered GI aimed at\nincorporating semantic aware search. We take a first step at it by augmenting\nGI with the use of automated clustering of LLM edits.
