Consequently, there is a growing need for more efficient testing methods. To reduce the burden on developers, various automated test generation tools have been developed, and several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the tests they produce. However, most of these studies focus primarily on coverage metrics, and only a few examine how well the tests support fault localization-particularly using artificial faults introduced through mutation testing. In this study, we compare the SBFL (Spectrum-Based Fault Localization) score and code coverage of automatically generated tests with those of manually created tests. The SBFL score indicates how accurately faults can be localized using SBFL techniques. By employing SBFL score as an evaluation metric-an approach rarely used in prior studies on test generation-we aim to provide new insights into the respective strengths and weaknesses of manually created and automatically generated tests. Our experimental results show that automatically generated tests achieve higher branch coverage than manually created tests, but their SBFL score is lower, especially for code with deeply nested structures. These findings offer guidance on how to effectively combine automatically generated and manually created testing approaches."}

However, existing LLMs face several challenges when generating Verilog code for finite state machine (FSM) control logic, including frequent syntax errors, low debugging efficiency, and heavy reliance on test benchmarks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes AutoFSM, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed for FSM code generation tasks. AutoFSM introduces a structurally clear intermediate representation (IR) to reduce syntax error rate during code generation and provides a supporting toolchain to enable automatic translation from IR to Verilog. Furthermore, AutoFSM is the first to integrate SystemC-based modeling with automatic testbench generation, thereby improving debugging efficiency and feedback quality. To systematically evaluate the framework's performance, we construct SKT-FSM, the first hierarchical FSM benchmark in the field, comprising 67 FSM samples across different complexity levels. Experimental results show that, under the same base LLM, AutoFSM consistently outperforms the open-source framework MAGE on the SKT-FSM benchmark, achieving up to an 11.94% improvement in pass rate and up to a 17.62% reduction in syntax error rate. These results demonstrate the potential of combining LLMs with structured IR and automated testing to improve the reliability and scalability of register-transfer level (RTL) code generation."}

Raghu Reddy"], "title": "REMODEL-LLM: Transforming C code to Java using LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "The automated translation of C code to Java code is a notoriously difficult task, fraught with challenges stemming from fundamental paradigm shifts (procedural vs. Object Oriented), memory models (manual pointers vs. Garbage Collection), and incompatible data types. This paper investigates the efficacy of 19 small, quantized LLMs (under 20 billion parameters) for the C to Java translation task. We use a novel, hybrid pipeline that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for semantic decomposition and employs a highly constrained, rule based prompting strategy. The results are stark: a clear multi tiered performance divide emerged. The vast majority of models (Tier 3, e.g., llama3.1, gemma3, starcoder2) failed 100\\% of the tests, proving incapable of generating even basic, runnable Java boilerplate. A small middle tier (Tier 2, e.g., mistral-nemo and mistral) produced runnable code but was plagued by dangerous semantic failures and wrong translations. Only three models (Tier 1: phi4, deepseek-coder-v2, codeqwen) proved viable, passing over 50\\% of the test suite. Even these top models failed on the most complex C concepts, such as function pointers, sizeof, and enum logic, revealing a hard ceiling for the reasoning capabilities of current quantized models."}

Gall"], "title": "Towards Privacy-Preserving Code Generation: Differentially Private Code Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models specialized for code (CodeLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating code snippets, documentation, and test cases. However, despite their promising capabilities, CodeLLMs can inadvertently memorize and reproduce snippets from their training data, which poses risks of privacy breaches and intellectual property violations. These risks restrict the deployment of CodeLLMs in sensitive domains and limit their training datasets to publicly available sources. To mitigate the memorization risk without compromising their task performance, we apply Differential Privacy (DP) to CodeLLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of DP in CodeLLMs. DP adds calibrated noise to the training process to protect individual data points while still allowing the model to learn useful patterns. To this end, we first identify and understand the driving reasons of the memorization behaviour of the CodeLLMs during their fine-tuning. Then, to address this issue, we empirically evaluate the effect of DP on mitigating memorization while preserving code generation capabilities. Our findings show that DP substantially reduces memorization in CodeLLMs across all the tested snippet types. The snippet types most prone to memorization are also the most effectively mitigated by DP. Furthermore, we observe that DP slightly increases perplexity but preserves, and can even enhance, the code generation capabilities of CodeLLMs, which makes it feasible to apply DP in practice without significantly compromising model utility. Finally, we analyze the impact of DP on training efficiency and energy consumption, finding that DP does not significantly affect training time or energy usage, making it a practical choice for privacy-preserving CodeLLMs training."}

We generalise the monadic metalanguage to a relative setting and give a complete semantics with strong relative monads. Adopting this perspective, we generalise two existing program calculi from the literature. We provide a linear-non-linear language for graded monads, LNL-RMM, along with a semantic proof that it is a conservative extension of the graded monadic metalanguage. Additionally, we provide a complete semantics for the arrow calculus, showing it is a restricted relative monadic metalanguage. This motivates the introduction of ARMM, a computational lambda calculus-style language for arrows that conservatively extends the arrow calculus."}

However, we still know little about how these agents use libraries when generating code, a core part of real-world software development. To fill this gap, we study 26,760 agent-authored PRs from the AIDev dataset to examine three questions: how often do agents import libraries, how often do they introduce new dependencies (and with what versioning), and which specific libraries do they choose? We find that agents often import libraries (29.5% of PRs) but rarely add new dependencies (1.3% of PRs); and when they do, they follow strong versioning practices (75.0% specify a version), an improvement on direct LLM usage where versions are rarely mentioned. Generally, agents draw from a surprisingly diverse set of external libraries, contrasting with the limited \"library preferences\" seen in prior non-agentic LLM studies. Our results offer an early empirical view into how AI coding agents interact with today's software ecosystems."}
