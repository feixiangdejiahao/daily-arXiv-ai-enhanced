The replication package will be made publicly available upon\n  acceptance", "summary": "Automated crash reporting systems generate large volumes of duplicate\nreports, overwhelming issue-tracking systems and increasing developer workload.\nTraditional stack trace-based deduplication methods, relying on string\nsimilarity, rule-based heuristics, or deep learning (DL) models, often fail to\ncapture the contextual and structural relationships within stack traces. We\npropose dedupT, a transformer-based approach that models stack traces\nholistically rather than as isolated frames. dedupT first adapts a pretrained\nlanguage model (PLM) to stack traces, then uses its embeddings to train a\nfully-connected network (FCN) to rank duplicate crashes effectively. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets show that dedupT outperforms existing DL and\ntraditional methods (e.g., sequence alignment and information retrieval\ntechniques) in both duplicate ranking and unique crash detection, significantly\nreducing manual triage effort. On four public datasets, dedupT improves Mean\nReciprocal Rank (MRR) often by over 15% compared to the best DL baseline and up\nto 9% over traditional methods while achieving higher Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) in detecting unique crash\nreports. Our work advances the integration of modern natural language\nprocessing (NLP) techniques into software engineering, providing an effective\nsolution for stack trace-based crash deduplication."}

However, reusing\npoorly understood code can lead to serious problems, such as bugs or security\nvulnerabilities. To better understand how code comments affect the perceived\nhelpfulness of Stack Overflow answers, we conducted an online experiment\nsimulating a Stack Overflow environment (n=91). The results indicate that both\nblock and inline comments are perceived as significantly more helpful than\nuncommented source code. Moreover, novices rated code snippets with block\ncomments as more helpful than those with inline comments. Interestingly, other\nsurface features, such as the position of an answer and its answer score, were\nconsidered less important. The content of Stack Overflow has been a major\nsource for training large language models. AI-based coding assistants such as\nGitHub Copilot, which are based on these models, might change the way Stack\nOverflow is used.

This study investigates the\nfeasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to assist in translating\nPL/SQL code into Java for the modernised \"VTF3\" system. By leveraging a dataset\ncomprising 10 PL/SQL-to-Java code pairs and 15 Java classes, which collectively\nestablished a domain model for the translated files, multiple LLMs were\nevaluated. Furthermore, we propose a customized prompting strategy that\nintegrates chain-of-guidance reasoning with $n$-shot prompting. Our findings\nindicate that this methodology effectively guides LLMs in generating\nsyntactically accurate translations while also achieving functional\ncorrectness.

Recently, CMSs have evolved,\nbecoming \\emph{headless}. Content served by a \\emph{headless CMS} aims to be\nconsumed by other applications and services through REST APIs rather than by\nhuman users through a web browser. This evolution has enabled CMSs to become a\nnotorious source of content to be used in a variety of contexts beyond pure web\nnavigation. As such, CMS have become an important component of many information\nsystems. Unfortunately, we still lack the tools to properly discover and manage\nthe information stored in a CMS, often highly customized to the needs of a\nspecific domain. Currently, this is mostly a time-consuming and error-prone\nmanual process.\n  In this paper, we propose a model-based framework to facilitate the\nintegration of headless CMSs in software development processes. Our framework\nis able to discover and explicitly represent the information schema behind the\nCMS. This facilitates designing the interaction between the CMS model and other\ncomponents consuming that information. These interactions are then generated as\npart of a middleware library that offers platform-agnostic access to the CMS to\nall the client applications. The complete framework is open-source and\navailable online."}

Recently, generative AI\nhas emerged as a powerful tool across many domains, and it is increasingly\nbeing applied to ADS testing due to its ability to interpret context, reason\nabout complex tasks, and generate diverse outputs. To gain a deeper\nunderstanding of its role in ADS testing, we systematically analyzed 91\nrelevant studies and synthesized their findings into six major application\ncategories, primarily centered on scenario-based testing of ADS.
