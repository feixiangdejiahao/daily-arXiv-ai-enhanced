Existing inference techniques, however, typically compute posterior distributions over program states at fixed time points, most often at termination, thereby failing to capture the temporal evolution of probabilistic behaviors. We introduce temporal posterior inference (TPI), a new framework that unifies probabilistic programming with temporal logic by computing posterior distributions over execution traces that satisfy omega-regular specifications, conditioned on possibly temporal observations. To obtain rigorous quantitative guarantees, we develop a new method for computing upper and lower bounds on the satisfaction probabilities of omega-regular properties. Our approach decomposes Rabin acceptance conditions into persistence and recurrence components and constructs stochastic barrier certificates that soundly bound each component. We implement our approach in a prototype tool, TPInfer, and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, demonstrating effective and efficient inference over rich temporal properties in probabilistic models."}

As these tools become deeply embedded in developers' daily workflows, understanding how they are used has become essential. This paper reports an empirical study of LLM adoption in software engineering, based on a survey of 46 industry professionals with diverse educational backgrounds and levels of experience. The results reveal positive perceptions of LLMs, particularly regarding faster resolution of technical questions, improved documentation support, and enhanced source code standardization. However, respondents also expressed concerns about cognitive dependence, security risks, and the potential erosion of technical autonomy. These findings underscore the need for critical and supervised use of LLM-based tools. By grounding the discussion in empirical evidence from industry practice, this study bridges the gap between academic discourse and real-world software development. The results provide actionable insights for developers and researchers seeking to adopt and evolve LLM-based technologies in a more effective, responsible, and secure manner, while also motivating future research on their cognitive, ethical, and organizational implications."}

Recognizing fairness explicitly as a software quality dimension yields practical benefits beyond ethical considerations, notably improved predictive performance for unprivileged groups, enhanced out-of-distribution generalization, and increased geographic transferability in real-world deployments. Nevertheless, existing bias mitigation methods face a critical dilemma: while pre-processing methods offer broad applicability across model types, they generally fall short in effectiveness compared to post-processing techniques. To overcome this challenge, we propose Correlation Tuning (CoT), a novel pre-processing approach designed to mitigate bias by adjusting data correlations. Specifically, CoT introduces the Phi-coefficient, an intuitive correlation measure, to systematically quantify correlation between sensitive attributes and labels, and employs multi-objective optimization to address the proxy biases. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CoT increases the true positive rate of unprivileged groups by an average of 17.5% and reduces three key bias metrics, including statistical parity difference (SPD), average odds difference (AOD), and equal opportunity difference (EOD), by more than 50% on average. CoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by three and ten percentage points in single attribute and multiple attributes scenarios, respectively. We will publicly release our experimental results and source code to facilitate future research."}

Developers can write a Github issue and assign it to an AI-agent like Copilot for implementation. Based on the issue and its related discussion, the AI-agent performs a plan for the implementation, and executes it. However, the performance of AI-agents and LLMs heavily depends on the input they receive. For instance, a GitHub issue that is unclear or not well scoped might not lead to a successful implementation that will eventually be merged. GitHub Copilot provides a set of best practice recommendations that are limited and high-level. In this paper, we build a set of 32 detailed criteria that we leverage to measure the quality of GitHub issues to make them suitable for AI-agents. We compare the GitHub issues that lead to a merged pull request versus closed pull request. Then, we build an interpretable machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a GitHub issue resulting in a merged pull request. We observe that pull requests that end up being merged are those originating from issues that are shorter, well scoped, with clear guidance and hints about the relevant artifacts for an issue, and with guidance on how to perform the implementation. Issues with external references including configuration, context setup, dependencies or external APIs are associated with lower merge rates. We built an interpretable machine learning model to help users identify how to improve a GitHub issue to increase the chances of the issue resulting in a merged pull request by Copilot. Our model has a median AUC of 72\\%. Our results shed light on quality metrics relevant for writing GitHub issues and motivate future studies further investigate the writing of GitHub issues as a first-class software engineering activity in the era of AI-teammates."}

A typical example is to detect runtime exceptions in online code snippets before integrating them into a codebase. In this paper, we propose Cerberus, a novel predictive, execution-free coverage-guided testing framework. Cerberus uses LLMs to generate the inputs that trigger runtime errors and to perform code coverage prediction and error detection without code execution. With a two-phase feedback loop, Cerberus first aims to both increasing code coverage and detecting runtime errors, then shifts to focus only detecting runtime errors when the coverage reaches 100% or its maximum, enabling it to perform better than prompting the LLMs for both purposes. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Cerberus performs better than conventional and learning-based testing frameworks for (in)complete code snippets by generating high-coverage test cases more efficiently, leading to the discovery of more runtime errors."}

Rather than conducting separate phases for generating a large corpus and subsequently minimizing it, we propose FuzzWise which integrates them into one process to generate the optimal initial corpus of seeds (ICS). FuzzWise leverages a multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). The first LLM agent generates test cases for the target program. The second LLM agent, which functions as a predictive code coverage module, assesses whether each generated test case will enhance the overall coverage of the current corpus. The streamlined process allows each newly generated test seed to be immediately evaluated for its contribution to the overall coverage. FuzzWise employs a predictive approach using an LLM and eliminates the need for actual execution, saving computational resources and time, particularly in scenarios where the execution is not desirable or even impossible. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that FuzzWise generates significantly fewer test cases than baseline methods. Despite the lower number of test cases, FuzzWise achieves high code coverage and triggers more runtime errors compared to the baselines. Moreover, it is more time-efficient and coverage-efficient in producing an initial corpus catching more errors."}

Traditional methods, such as static logging and post-crash analysis, lack real-time contextual information, rendering them ineffective against \"ghost bugs\" that only manifest in specific scenarios. This highlights an urgent need for dynamic runtime observability: intercepting and tracing arbitrary methods in production without requiring an app release. We propose XTrace, a novel dynamic tracing framework. XTrace introduces a new paradigm of non-invasive proxying, which avoids direct modification of the virtual machine's underlying data structures. It achieves high-performance method interception by leveraging and optimizing the highly stable, built-in instrumentation mechanism of the Android ART virtual machine. Evaluated in a ByteDance application with hundreds of millions of daily active users, XTrace demonstrated production-grade stability and performance. Large-scale online A/B experiments confirmed its stability, showing no statistically significant impact (p > 0.05) on Crash User Rate or ANR rate, while maintaining minimal overhead (<7 ms startup latency, <0.01 ms per-method call) and broad compatibility (Android 5.0-15+). Critically, XTrace diagnosed over 11 severe online crashes and multiple performance bottlenecks, improving root-cause localization efficiency by over 90%. This confirms XTrace provides a production-grade solution that reconciles the long-standing conflict between stability and comprehensive coverage in Android dynamic tracing."}

To fill this gap, we present \\methodName, a novel approach based on LLMs that achieves repository-level type inference through the co-evolution of types and dependencies. \\methodName~constructs an Entity Dependency Graph (EDG) to model the objects and type dependencies across the repository.

To select the most compatible parser for a specific system, multiple evaluation metrics are commonly used for performance comparisons. However, existing evaluation metrics heavily rely on labeled log data, which limits prior studies to a fixed set of datasets and hinders parser evaluations and selections in the industry. Further, we discovered that different versions of ground-truth used in existing studies can lead to inconsistent performance conclusions. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel label-free template-level metric, PMSS (parser medoid silhouette score), to evaluate log parser performance. PMSS evaluates both parser grouping and template quality with medoid silhouette analysis and Levenshtein distance within a near-linear time complexity in general. To understand its relationship with label-based template-level metrics, FGA and FTA, we compared their evaluation outcomes for six log parsers on the standard corrected Loghub 2.0 dataset. Our results indicate that log parsers achieving the highest PMSS or FGA exhibit comparable performance, differing by only 2.1% on average in terms of the FGA score; the difference is 9.8% for FTA. PMSS is also significantly (p<1e-8) and positively correlated to both FGA and FTA: the Spearman's rho correlation coefficient of PMSS-FGA and PMSS-FTA are respectively 0.648 and 0.587, close to the coefficient between FGA and FTA (0.670). We further extended our discussion on how to interpret the conclusions from different metrics, identifying challenges in using PMSS, and provided guidelines on conducting parser selections with our metric. PMSS provides a valuable evaluation alternative when ground-truths are inconsistent or labels are unavailable."}

As an exemplar, we propose an architecture of a multi-agent system for the implementation phase of the software engineering process. We also present a comprehensive threat model for the proposed system. We demonstrate that while such systems can generate code quite accurately, they are vulnerable to attacks, including code injection. Due to their autonomous design and lack of humans in the loop, these systems cannot identify and respond to attacks by themselves. This paper analyzes the vulnerability of multi-agent systems and concludes that the coder-reviewer-tester architecture is more resilient than both the coder and coder-tester architectures, but is less efficient at writing code. We find that by adding a security analysis agent, we mitigate the loss in efficiency while achieving even better resiliency. We conclude by demonstrating that the security analysis agent is vulnerable to advanced code injection attacks, showing that embedding poisonous few-shot examples in the injected code can increase the attack success rate from 0% to 71.95%."}

There are many practical achievements in binary code analysis, but fine-grained analysis such as dynamic taint analysis, is constantly studied due to the problem of deployability, high memory usage, and performance overhead, so as to better adapt to the new analysis scenario, such as memory corruption exploits and sandbox evasion malware. This paper presents a new binary program analysis framework, in order to improve the usability and performance of fine-grained analysis. The framework mainly uses the kernel module to further expand the analysis capability of the traditional dynamic binary instrumentation. Then, based on the idea of decoupling analysis, the analysis environment is constructed in the container process through process hollowing techniques in a new way. It can reuse the functions of the existing dynamic binary instrumentation platforms and also reduce the impact on the execution of the target program.
