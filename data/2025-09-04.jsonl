While knowledge graphs and ontologies are eminently useful to represent\nformal knowledge about a system's individuals and universals, programming\nlanguages are designed to describe the system's evolution. To address this\ndichotomy, we introduce a semantic lifting of the program states of an\nexecuting program into a knowledge graph, for an object-oriented programming\nlanguage. The resulting graph is exposed as a semantic reflection layer within\nthe programming language, allowing programmers to leverage knowledge of the\napplication domain in their programs. In this paper, we formalize semantic\nlifting and semantic reflection for a small programming language, SMOL, explain\nthe operational aspects of the language, and consider type correctness and\nvirtualisation for runtime program queries through the semantic reflection\nlayer. We illustrate semantic lifting and semantic reflection through a case\nstudy of geological modelling and discuss different applications of the\ntechnique. The language implementation is open source and available online."}

However, this decentralized development by separate teams\nand continuous evolution can introduce miscommunication and incompatible\nimplementations, undermining system maintainability and reliability across\naspects from security policy to system architecture. We propose a novel\nmethodology that statically reconstructs microservice source code into a formal\nsystem model. From this model, a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)\nconstraint set can be derived, enabling formal verification. Our methodology is\nextensible, supporting software verification across multiple cross-cutting\nconcerns. We focus on applying the methodology to verify the system\narchitecture concern, presenting formal reasoning to validate the methodology's\ncorrectness and applicability for this concern. Additional concerns such as\nsecurity policy implementation are considered. Future directions are\nestablished to extend and evaluate the methodology."}

An Empirical Study on Prompting LLMs to Detect Design Principle Violations", "comment": "Accepted to ASE2025", "summary": "Traditional static analysis methods struggle to detect semantic design flaws,\nsuch as violations of the SOLID principles, which require a strong\nunderstanding of object-oriented design patterns and principles. Existing\nsolutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific\nprogramming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across\nall five principles in multi-language codebases. This paper presents a new\napproach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess\nLLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We\npresent a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder,\nand GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID\nprinciples. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240\nmanually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct\nprompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and\nchain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection\naccuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with\nGPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with\nchallenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a\ndramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a\ndeliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE\nprompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection\naccuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply\nwith increasing code complexity. These initial findings demonstrate that\neffective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a\ntailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific\ndesign context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability\nthrough AI-assisted code analysis."}

Nevertheless, existing datasets predominantly rely on\nsuperficial validation methods rather than exploit-based verification, leading\nto overestimated performance in security-sensitive applications. This paper\nintroduces VulnRepairEval, an evaluation framework anchored in functional\nProof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits. Our framework delivers a comprehensive,\ncontainerized evaluation pipeline that enables reproducible differential\nassessment, where repair success requires the original exploit to fail\nexecution against the modified code. The benchmark construction involved\nextensive data curation: we processed over 400 CVEs and approximately 2,500\npotential sources to extract a collection of authentic vulnerability instances\n(23 Python CVEs) amenable to automated testing with working PoCs. Through\nVulnRepairEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 12 popular LLMs and\nobserve a significant performance deficit: even the top-performing model\nsuccessfully addresses merely 5/23 instances (about 21.7%), exposing critical\nweaknesses in security-focused applications. Our failure analysis reveals that\nmost unsuccessful attempts stem from imprecise vulnerability identification and\npatches containing syntactic or semantic errors. Enhanced prompting strategies\nand multi-agent approaches yield minimal improvements, with overall\neffectiveness remaining largely unaffected.

A common approach is\nan iterative generate-critique-refine loop, where candidate models are\nproduced, evaluated, and updated based on detected issues. This process needs\nto address: (1) structural correctness - compliance with well-formedness rules\n- and (2) semantic alignment - accurate reflection of the intended meaning in\nthe source text. We present LADEX (LLM-based Activity Diagram Extractor), a\npipeline for deriving activity diagrams from natural-language process\ndescriptions using an LLM-driven critique-refine process. Structural checks in\nLADEX can be performed either algorithmically or by an LLM, while alignment\nchecks are always performed by an LLM. We design five ablated variants of LADEX\nto study: (i) the impact of the critique-refine loop itself, (ii) the role of\nLLM-based semantic checks, and (iii) the comparative effectiveness of\nalgorithmic versus LLM-based structural checks.\n  To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with\nexpert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics. This\nenables automated measurement of correctness and completeness. Experiments on\ntwo datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural\nvalidity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2)\nalgorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks\nfail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness\nby 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks\nwith LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4\nMini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of\nup to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer\nthan five LLM calls on average."}
