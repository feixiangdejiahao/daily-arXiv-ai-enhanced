Synthetic Tait Computability\n(STC) provides an abstract treatment of the complex gluing models by\ninternalizing the gluing category into a modal dependent type theory with a\nphase distinction. This work presents a mechanization of STC in the Istari\nproof assistant. Istari is a Martin-L\\\"{o}f-style extensional type theory with\nequality reflection. Equality reflection eliminates the nuisance of transport\nreasoning typically found in intensional proof assistants. This work develops a\nreusable library for synthetic phase distinction, including modalities,\nextension types, and strict glue types, and applies it to two case studies: (1)\na canonicity model for dependent type theory with dependent products and\nbooleans with large elimination, and (2) a Kripke canonicity model for the\ncost-aware logical framework.

While\nmost theoretical studies have focused on multi-shot control operators, one-shot\ncontrol operators -- which restrict the use of captured continuations to at\nmost once -- are gaining attention for their balance between expressiveness and\nefficiency. This study aims to fill the gap. We present a mathematically\nrigorous comparison of the expressive power among one-shot control operators,\nincluding effect handlers, delimited continuations, and even asymmetric\ncoroutines. Following previous studies on multi-shot control operators, we\nadopt Felleisen's macro-expressiveness as our measure of expressiveness. We\nverify the folklore that one-shot effect handlers and one-shot\ndelimited-control operators can be macro-expressed by asymmetric coroutines,\nbut not vice versa.

Training the model for vulnerability localization\nusually requires ground-truth labels at the statement-level, and labeling\nvulnerable statements demands expert knowledge, which incurs high costs. Hence,\nthe demand for an approach that eliminates the need for additional labeling at\nthe statement-level is on the rise. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\napproach called WAVES for WeAkly supervised Vulnerability Localization via\nmultiplE inStance learning, which does not need the additional statement-level\nlabels during the training. WAVES has the capability to determine whether a\nfunction is vulnerable (i.e., vulnerability detection) and pinpoint the\nvulnerable statements (i.e., vulnerability localization).

A Comprehensive Study on Execution Trace-Based Information for Code Large Language Models", "comment": "EMNLP2025-findings", "summary": "Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming\nwith their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed\ncritical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and\nunderstand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant\nchallenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code\nLLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning\nabout program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs\nactually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented\nrepresentation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across\nexisting methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason\neffectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic\napproaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these\nissues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic\ninformation~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct\na comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing\nthe reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on\ninvestigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting\nsupervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The\nexperimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate\nthat semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling\nof Code LLM."}
