As LLMs increasingly serve as evaluators in code-based RL, their ability to detect reward hacking remains understudied. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy of reward exploits spanning across 54 categories and introduce TRACE (Testing Reward Anomalies in Code Environments), a synthetically curated and human-verified benchmark containing 517 testing trajectories. Unlike prior work that evaluates reward hack detection in isolated classification scenarios, we contrast these evaluations with a more realistic, contrastive anomaly detection setup on TRACE. Our experiments reveal that models capture reward hacks more effectively in contrastive settings than in isolated classification settings, with GPT-5.2 with highest reasoning mode achieving the best detection rate at 63%, up from 45% in isolated settings on TRACE. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art models struggle significantly more with semantically contextualized reward hacks compared to syntactically contextualized ones. We further conduct qualitative analyses of model behaviors, as well as ablation studies showing that the ratio of benign to hacked trajectories and analysis cluster sizes substantially impact detection performance. We release the benchmark and evaluation harness to enable the community to expand TRACE and evaluate their models."}

An Empirical Study of Core and Peripheral Developers Use of Coding Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous AI agents are transforming software development and redefining how developers collaborate with AI. Prior research shows that the adoption and use of AI-powered tools differ between core and peripheral developers. However, it remains unclear how this dynamic unfolds in the emerging era of autonomous coding agents. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of 9,427 agentic PRs, examining how core and peripheral developers use, review, modify, and verify agent-generated contributions prior to acceptance. Through a mix of qualitative and quantitative analysis, we make four key contributions. First, a subset of peripheral developers use agents more often, delegating tasks evenly across bug fixing, feature addition, documentation, and testing. In contrast, core developers focus more on documentation and testing, yet their agentic PRs are frequently merged into the main/master branch. Second, core developers engage slightly more in review discussions than peripheral developers, and both groups focus on evolvability issues. Third, agentic PRs are less likely to be modified, but when they are, both groups commonly perform refactoring. Finally, peripheral developers are more likely to merge without running CI checks, whereas core developers more consistently require passing verification before acceptance. Our analysis offers a comprehensive view of how developer experience shapes integration offer insights for both peripheral and core developers on how to effectively collaborate with coding agents."}

To address this gap, we analyze 1,210 merged agent-generated bug-fix PRs from Python repositories in the AIDev dataset. Using SonarQube, we perform a differential analysis between base and merged commits to identify code quality issues newly introduced by PR changes. We examine issue frequency, density, severity, and rule-level prevalence across five agents. Our results show that apparent differences in raw issue counts across agents largely disappear after normalizing by code churn, indicating that higher issue counts are primarily driven by larger PRs. Across all agents, code smells dominate, particularly at critical and major severities, while bugs are less frequent but often severe. Overall, our findings show that merge success does not reliably reflect post-merge code quality, highlighting the need for systematic quality checks for agent-generated bug-fix PRs."}

Among their most impactful applications is code generation, where ILMs--commonly referred to as Code Language Models CLMs--have demonstrated remarkable capability. This strength stems from their defining feature: the use of explicit task instructions during fine-tuning, which enables them to bridge natural language and code by translating human intent into executable code. While much of their progress has been driven by advances in scaling laws and training methodologies, one critical aspect remains underexplored--the impact of system prompts on the performance of both general-purpose ILMs and specialized CLMs when instantiated to assist users with code generation activities. In this study, we take a first step toward bridging this gap by systematically evaluating how system prompts of varying instructional detail, along with model scale, prompting strategy, and programming language, affect ILMs and CLMs in code generation tasks. Our evaluation framework, spanning 120 model configurations, reveals that (1) the influence of system prompts increases with model scale; (2) few-shot prompting reduces this effect compared to zero-shot; and (3) programming language matters, with Java showing greater sensitivity to system prompt variations than Python."}

Yet their growing volume and verbosity make both manual inspection and automated analysis increasingly costly, time-consuming, and environmentally costly. While prior work has explored log compression, anomaly detection, and LLM-based log analysis, most efforts target structured system logs rather than the unstructured, noisy, and verbose logs typical of CI workflows.\n  We present LogSieve, a lightweight, RCA-aware and semantics-preserving log reduction technique that filters low-information lines while retaining content relevant to downstream reasoning. Evaluated on CI logs from 20 open-source Android projects using GitHub Actions, LogSieve achieves an average 42% reduction in lines and 40% reduction in tokens with minimal semantic loss. This pre-inference reduction lowers computational cost and can proportionally reduce energy use (and associated emissions) by decreasing the volume of data processed during LLM inference.\n  Compared with structure-first baselines (LogZip and random-line removal), LogSieve preserves much higher semantic and categorical fidelity (Cosine = 0.93, GPTScore = 0.93, 80% exact-match accuracy). Embedding-based classifiers automate relevance detection with near-human accuracy (97%), enabling scalable and sustainable integration of semantics-aware filtering into CI workflows. LogSieve thus bridges log management and LLM reasoning, offering a practical path toward greener and more interpretable CI automation."}

However, sophisticated software supply chain security threats often stem from cascaded vulnerability and security weakness chains that span dependent components. Moreover, although the adoption of Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) has been accelerating, downstream vulnerability findings vary substantially across SBOM generators and analysis tools. We propose a novel approach to SBOM-driven security analysis methods and tools. We model vulnerability relationships over dependency structure rather than treating scanner outputs as independent records. We represent enriched SBOMs as heterogeneous graphs with nodes being the SBOM components and dependencies, the known software vulnerabilities, and the known software security weaknesses. We then train a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HGAT) to predict whether a component is associated with at least one known vulnerability. Since documented multi-vulnerability chains are scarce, we model cascade discovery as a link prediction problem over CVE pairs using a multi-layer perceptron neural network. This way, we produce ranked candidate links that can be composed into multi-step paths. The HGAT component classifier achieves an Accuracy of 91.03% and an F1-score of 74.02%."}

In this study, we present the first analysis of agentic refactoring pull requests in Java, comparing them to developer refactorings across 86 projects per group. Using RefactoringMiner and DesigniteJava 3.0, we identify refactoring types and detect code smells before and after refactoring commits. Our results show that agent refactorings are dominated by annotation changes (the 5 most common refactoring types done by agents are annotation related), in contrast to the diverse structural improvements typical of developers. Despite these differences in refactoring types, we find Cursor to be the only model to show a statistically significant increase in refactoring smells."}

However, recent vulnerabilities in third-party packages have led to serious security breaches, compromising the integrity of applications that depend on them. Objective: This study investigates how npm package developers perceive and handle security in their work. We examined developers' understanding of security risks, the practices and tools they use, the barriers to stronger security measures, and their suggestions for improving the npm ecosystem's security. Method: We conducted an online survey with 75 npm package developers and undertook a mixed-methods approach to analyzing their responses. Results: While developers prioritize security, they perceive their packages as only moderately secure, with concerns about supply chain attacks, dependency vulnerabilities, and malicious code. Only 40% are satisfied with the current npm security tools due to issues such as alert fatigue. Automated methods such as two-factor authentication and npm audit are favored over code reviews. Many drop dependencies due to abandonment or vulnerabilities, and typically respond to vulnerabilities in their packages by quickly releasing patches. Key barriers include time constraints and high false-positive rates. To improve npm security, developers seek better detection tools, clearer documentation, stronger account protections, and more education initiatives. Conclusion: Our findings will benefit npm package contributors and maintainers by highlighting prevalent security challenges and promoting discussions on best practices to strengthen security and trustworthiness within the npm landscape."}

To facilitate their adoption by language designers, the comprehensibility of the language used to define other languages is an important aspect to evaluate. Moreover, considering that language workbenches are relatively new tools, user acceptance emerges as a crucial factor to be accounted for during their assessment. Current literature often neglects user-centred aspects like comprehensibility and acceptance in the assessment of this breed of tools. This paper addresses this gap through a family of experiments assessing Neverlang, a modular language workbench. The study adopts a tailored version of the Method Evaluation Model (MEM) to evaluate the comprehensibility of Neverlang's meta-language and programs, as well as user acceptance in terms of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use. It also investigates the relationships among these dimensions. The experiments were conducted in three iterations involving participants from academia. The results reveal that users demonstrate sufficient comprehension of Neverlang's meta-language, particularly concerning its syntax, express a favourable perception of its usefulness, and indicate their intention to use it. However, the results also indicate that Neverlang's ease of use remains a challenge. Additionally, variations in the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, whether low or high, influence the users' intention to use the tool. Surprisingly, no significant correlation is found between comprehensibility and user acceptance. Notably, higher comprehensibility of the meta-language does not necessarily translate into greater acceptance, underscoring the complex interplay between comprehension and adoption."}

By strategically poisoning retrieval contexts through a mutation-based approach, DrainCode forces LLMs to produce significantly longer outputs, thereby increasing GPU latency and energy consumption. We evaluate the effectiveness of DrainCode across multiple models.

Unlike general-purpose engines such as ONNX Runtime, today's LLM inference systems offer little operator-level visibility, leaving developers blind to where time and resources go. Even basic questions -- is this workload memory-bound or compute-bound? -- often remain unanswered. To close this gap, we develop a fine-grained, non-intrusive profiling framework for modern LLM inference engines, exemplified by llama.cpp but applicable to similar runtime architectures. Built on extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology, our system dynamically attaches probes to runtime functions across multiple layers -- without modifying or recompiling the source. It transforms collected traces into rich visualizations of operators, graphs, timelines, and hardware counter trends, exposing how dense inference, Mixture-of-Experts routing, and operator offloading behave in practice. With less than 4% runtime overhead and high profiling fidelity, our framework makes LLM inference both transparent and diagnosable, turning performance profiling into a practical tool for optimization, scheduling, and resource-aware deployment."}
