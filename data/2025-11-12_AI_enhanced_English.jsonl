For instance, an $(O(n^2))$ versus $(O(n \\log n))$ sorting algorithm may yield similar output but incur vastly different performance costs in production. This discrepancy reveals a critical limitation in current evaluation methods: they fail to capture the behavioral and performance diversity among correct solutions. To address this, we introduce a principled framework for evaluating the dynamic stability of generated code. We propose two metrics derived from opcode distributions: Static Canonical Trace Divergence (SCTD), which captures algorithmic structure diversity across generated solutions, and Dynamic Canonical Trace Divergence (DCTD), which quantifies runtime behavioral variance. Their ratio, the Behavioral Expression Factor (BEF), serves as a diagnostic signal: it indicates critical runtime instability when BEF $\\ll$ 1 and functional redundancy when BEF $\\gg$ 1. Empirical results on BigOBench and CodeContests show that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant algorithmic variance even among functionally correct outputs. Notably, increasing sampling temperature improves pass@1 rates but degrades stability, revealing an unrecognized trade-off: searching for correct solutions in diverse output spaces introduces a \"penalty of instability\" between correctness and behavioral consistency.

We benchmark 22 state-of-the-art models on code generation and summarization tasks, proposing two rating methods: Concentric Incremental Rating Circles (CIRC) and Observation to Expectation Rating (OTER). CIRC provides deterministic Euclidean-based rankings with static trade-offs that are robust to outliers, and OTER offers trend-aware evaluation with dynamic trade-offs that capture the complex correlation between energy and accuracy, each offering a distinct perspective and addressing the problem in a unique way. These rating methods enable us to rate LLMs on a 1-5 scale reflecting their combined capabilities in terms of energy efficiency and functional correctness. Our analysis reveals models generally perform better in the code summarization tasks as they are not enforced to generate a grammar-based and syntactically correct output. Also, we find that models' size does not have a significant impact on their ratings, indicating that if models utilize their parameters efficiently, they can be ranked higher on these scales.

Ensuring the quality of such systems is critical, as incorrect answers could lead to significant harm. Current state-of-the-art testing approaches apply metamorphic relations to existing test datasets, generating test questions based on these relations. However, these methods have two key limitations. First, they often produce unnatural questions that humans are unlikely to ask, reducing the effectiveness of the generated questions in identifying bugs that might occur in real-world scenarios. Second, these questions are generated from pre-existing test datasets, ignoring the broader context and thus limiting the diversity and relevance of the generated questions.\n  In this work, we introduce CQ^2A, a context-driven question generation approach for testing question-answering systems. Specifically, CQ^2A extracts entities and relationships from the context to form ground truth answers, and utilizes large language models to generate questions based on these ground truth answers and the surrounding context. We also propose the consistency verification and constraint checking to increase the reliability of LLM's outputs. Experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that CQ^2A outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the bug detection capability, the naturalness of the generated questions as well as the coverage of the context. Moreover, the test cases generated by CQ^2A reduce error rate when utilized for fine-tuning the QA software under test", "AI": {"tldr": "CQ^2A is a context-driven method that uses LLMs to generate more natural and diverse test questions for QA systems, leading to better bug detection and improved system performance.", "motivation": "Existing testing methods for question-answering (QA) software often generate test questions that are unnatural and lack contextual diversity, limiting their effectiveness for real-world bug detection.

We observed developers' decision-making in think-aloud sessions and discussed it in follow-up interviews. We found that participants struggled with all three sources: personal knowledge was insufficient, web content was often too complex, and while AI assistants provided clear and user-tailored responses, they lacked contextual relevance and failed to identify scenario-specific issues.

The recent explosive development of LLM extends the family of SCMs,bringing LLMs for code that revolutionize development workflows. Investigating different kinds of SCM vulnerability is the cornerstone for the security and trustworthiness of AI-powered software ecosystems, however, the fundamental one, transferable vulnerability, remains critically underexplored. Existing studies neither offer practical ways, i.e. require access to the downstream classifier of SCMs, to produce effective adversarial samples for adversarial defense, nor give heed to the widely used LLM4Code in modern software development platforms and cloud-based integrated development environments. Therefore, this work systematically studies the intrinsic vulnerability transferability of both traditional SCMs and LLM4Code, and proposes a victim-agnostic approach to generate practical adversarial samples. We design HABITAT, consisting of a tailored perturbation-inserting mechanism and a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework that adaptively selects optimal perturbations without requiring any access to the downstream classifier of SCMs. Furthermore, an intrinsic transferability analysis of SCM vulnerabilities is conducted, revealing the potential vulnerability correlation between traditional SCMs and LLM4Code, together with fundamental factors that govern the success rate of victim-agnostic transfer attacks. These findings of SCM vulnerabilities underscore the critical focal points for developing robust defenses in the future.
