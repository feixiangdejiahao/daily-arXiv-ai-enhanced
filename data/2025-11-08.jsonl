Ruby, despite its widespread use in web\ndevelopment and the persistent challenges faced by its developers, has received\nlittle attention in APR research. In this paper, we introduce RAMP, a novel\nlightweight framework that formulates program repair as a feedback-driven,\niterative process for Ruby. RAMP employs a team of collaborative agents that\ngenerate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine candidate fixes until a\ncorrect solution is found. Unlike prior approaches, RAMP is designed to avoid\nreliance on large multilingual repair databases or costly fine-tuning, instead\noperating directly on Ruby through lightweight prompting and test-driven\nfeedback. Evaluation on the XCodeEval benchmark shows that RAMP achieves a\npass@1 of 67% on Ruby, outper-forming prior approaches. RAMP converges quickly\nwithin five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and\nself-reflection are key drivers of its performance.

When code\nbehavior differs from these expectations, it becomes a potential vulnerability.\nHowever, such knowledge is rarely explicit in training data, leaving models\nunable to reason about security flaws. We propose VulInstruct, a\nspecification-guided approach that systematically extracts security\nspecifications from historical vulnerabilities to detect new ones. VulInstruct\nconstructs a specification knowledge base from two perspectives: (i) General\nspecifications from high-quality patches across projects, capturing fundamental\nsafe behaviors; and (ii) Domain-specific specifications from repeated\nviolations in particular repositories relevant to the target code. VulInstruct\nretrieves relevant past cases and specifications, enabling LLMs to reason about\nexpected safe behaviors rather than relying on surface patterns. We evaluate\nVulInstruct under strict criteria requiring both correct predictions and valid\nreasoning.
