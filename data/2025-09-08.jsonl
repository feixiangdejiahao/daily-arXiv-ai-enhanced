Test skeletons are especially\nimportant in test-driven development (TDD), where they provide an early\nframework for systematic verification. Traditionally authored manually, their\ncreation can be time-consuming and error-prone, particularly in educational or\nlarge-scale development settings. We evaluate four LLMs -- GPT-4,\nDeepSeek-Chat, Llama4-Maverick, and Gemma2-9B -- on their ability to generate\nRSpec skeletons for a real-world Ruby class developed in a university software\nengineering course. Each model's output is assessed using static analysis and a\nblind expert review to measure structural correctness, clarity,\nmaintainability, and conformance to testing best practices. The study reveals\nkey differences in how models interpret code structure and testing conventions,\noffering insights into the practical challenges of using LLMs for automated\ntest scaffolding. Our results show that DeepSeek generated the most\nmaintainable and well-structured skeletons, while GPT-4 produced more complete\nbut conventionally inconsistent output.

We address this challenge by leveraging Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to translate code changes from well-resourced languages\ninto equivalent changes in underrepresented or emerging languages, generating\nsynthetic training data where labelled examples are scarce. We assume that\nalthough LLMs have learned the syntax and semantics of new languages from\navailable unlabelled code, they have yet to fully grasp which code changes are\nconsidered significant or review-worthy within these emerging ecosystems. To\novercome this, we use LLMs to generate synthetic change examples and train\nsupervised classifiers on them. We systematically compare the performance of\nthese classifiers against models trained on real labelled data. Our experiments\nacross multiple GitHub repositories and language pairs demonstrate that\nLLM-generated synthetic data can effectively bootstrap review recommendation\nsystems, narrowing the performance gap even in low-resource settings. This\napproach provides a scalable pathway to extend automated code review\ncapabilities to rapidly evolving technology stacks, even in the absence of\nannotated data."}

This paper presents the first empirical step.\nMethod: We conducted a pilot repository mining study of 400 GitHub projects,\nanalyzing README files and issues discussions to identify the presence of\nmotivator and demotivator previously synthesized in our literature review [ 8]\nstudy. Results: Motivators such as engagement and motivation (227 hits),\nsoftware engineering process understanding (133 hits), and programming\nassistance and debugging support (97 hits) were strongly represented.\nDemotivators, including plagiarism and IP concerns (385 hits), security,\nprivacy and data integrity (87 hits), and over-reliance on AI in learning (39\nhits), also appeared prominently.

Traditional grey-box fuzzers guide test case generation\nprimarily using control flow edge coverage, which can overlook bugs not easily\nexposed through control flow analysis alone. We argue that integrating dataflow\nanalysis into the fuzzing process can enhance its effectiveness by revealing\nhow data propagates through the program, thereby enabling the exploration of\nexecution paths that control flow-based methods might miss. In this context, we\nintroduce FuzzRDUCC, a novel fuzzing framework that employs symbolic execution\nto reconstruct definition-use (def-use) chains directly from binary\nexecutables. FuzzRDUCC identifies crucial dataflow paths and exposes security\nvulnerabilities without incurring excessive computational overhead, due to a\nnovel heuristic algorithm that selects relevant def-use chains without\naffecting the thoroughness of the fuzzing process. We evaluate FuzzRDUCC using\nthe binutils benchmark and demonstrate that it can identify unique crashes not\nfound by state-of-the-art fuzzers. Hence, establishing FuzzRDUCC as a feasible\nsolution for next generation vulnerability detection and discovery mechanisms."}
