### [1] [VisCoder2: Building Multi-Language Visualization Coding Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23642)
*Yuansheng Ni,Songcheng Cai,Xiangchao Chen,Jiarong Liang,Zhiheng Lyu,Jiaqi Deng,Kai Zou,Ping Nie,Fei Yuan,Xiang Yue,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-language dataset, a new benchmark, and a family of models (VisCoder2) for visualization code generation, enabling more reliable and iterative solutions that outperform leading open-source tools and approach proprietary model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coding agents powered by large language models struggle with visualization tasks due to narrow language support, unreliable execution, and lack of multi-round correction mechanisms. The progress in this domain is stunted by single-language, single-turn datasets and benchmarks.

Method: The paper presents three new resources: (1) VisCode-Multi-679K, a large multi-language, multi-turn visualization code dataset; (2) VisPlotBench, a benchmark for multi-round evaluation with executable tasks and outputs; and (3) VisCoder2, a family of models trained on the new dataset and tested across multiple languages with iterative self-debugging.

Result: VisCoder2, when evaluated using VisPlotBench, outperforms strong open-source baselines and gets close to the proprietary GPT-4.1 model, reaching 82.4% execution pass rate at 32B model scale, especially in symbolic or compiler-dependent languages.

Conclusion: The new dataset, benchmark, and model advances the field of visualization coding agents, enabling more robust, multi-language, and iterative code generation and revision. Iterative correction and broader language support are key to improved performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled coding agents capable of
generating, executing, and revising visualization code. However, existing
models often fail in practical workflows due to limited language coverage,
unreliable execution, and lack of iterative correction mechanisms. Progress has
been constrained by narrow datasets and benchmarks that emphasize single-round
generation and single-language tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce
three complementary resources for advancing visualization coding agents.
VisCode-Multi-679K is a large-scale, supervised dataset containing 679K
validated and executable visualization samples with multi-turn correction
dialogues across 12 programming languages. VisPlotBench is a benchmark for
systematic evaluation, featuring executable tasks, rendered outputs, and
protocols for both initial generation and multi-round self-debug. Finally, we
present VisCoder2, a family of multi-language visualization models trained on
VisCode-Multi-679K. Experiments show that VisCoder2 significantly outperforms
strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary
models like GPT-4.1, with further gains from iterative self-debug, reaching
82.4% overall execution pass rate at the 32B scale, particularly in symbolic or
compiler-dependent languages.

*Fred Zimmerman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Xynapse Traces uses human-AI collaboration, automation, and innovative workflows to create a rapid, cost-effective, and high-quality publishing imprint, suggesting a future of democratized book production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional publishing is slow, costly, and inaccessible for niche and emerging markets. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging advanced human-AI integration.

Method: A fusion of human and algorithmic methods under a configuration-driven architecture and multi-model AI framework, with continuous ideation, automation throughout the workflow, and human-in-the-loop verification.

Result: Time-to-market reduced from 6-12 months to 2-4 weeks (90% decrease), costs cut by 80%, 52 books published in year one, 99% citation accuracy, and 100% validation success post-correction. The approach enables scalability, accessibility, and high quality.

Conclusion: Xynapse Traces demonstrates that a configuration-driven, multi-model AI-powered approach can drastically improve efficiency and accessibility in book publishing, enabling democratization of production while maintaining high standards.

Abstract: Xynapse Traces is an experimental publishing imprint created via a fusion of
human and algorithmic methods using a configuration-driven architecture and a
multi-model AI integration framework. The system achieved a remarkable 90%
reduction in time-to-market (from a typical 6-12 months to just 2-4 weeks),
with 80% cost reduction compared to traditional imprint development, while
publishing 52 books in its first year and maintaining exceptional quality
metrics, including 99% citation accuracy and 100% validation success after
initial corrections. Key technical innovations include a continuous ideation
pipeline with tournament-style evaluation, a novel codex design for
transcriptive meditation practice, comprehensive automation spanning from
ideation through production and distribution, and publisher personas that
define and guide the imprint's mission. The system also integrates automated
verification with human oversight, ensuring that gains in speed do not
compromise publishing standards. This effort has significant implications for
the future of book publishing, suggesting new paradigms for human-AI
collaboration that democratize access to sophisticated publishing capabilities
and make previously unviable niche markets accessible.

### [3] [Agentsway -- Software Development Methodology for AI Agents-based Teams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23664)
*Eranga Bandara,Ross Gore,Xueping Liang,Sachini Rajapakse,Isurunima Kularathne,Pramoda Karunarathna,Peter Foytik,Sachin Shetty,Ravi Mukkamala,Abdul Rahman,Amin Hass,Ng Wee Keong,Kasun De Zoysa,Aruna Withanage,Nilaan Loganathan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agentsway, a novel framework explicitly designed for agentic AI-driven software engineering, addressing the shortcomings of traditional human-centric methods by formalizing agent roles, integrating privacy and responsible AI, and enabling self-improving, transparent software development teams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional software development methods are human-centered and inadequate for environments where autonomous AI agents are core contributors. A new methodology is needed for agent-centric collaboration.

Method: Agentsway introduces a structured software development lifecycle where specialized AI agents carry out distinct roles (planning, coding, testing, etc.) with human orchestration and privacy-preserving collaboration, using fine-tuned LLMs and advanced reasoning models.

Result: Agentsway enables iterative improvement, adaptive learning, and explainable decision-making in AI agent-centric software projects, with improved domain-specific reasoning, transparency, and accountability.

Conclusion: Agentsway establishes a foundational methodology for AI agent-based software engineering teams, integrating privacy-by-design, ethical AI, and measurable productivity/trust metrics.

Abstract: The emergence of Agentic AI is fundamentally transforming how software is
designed, developed, and maintained. Traditional software development
methodologies such as Agile, Kanban, ShapeUp, etc, were originally designed for
human-centric teams and are increasingly inadequate in environments where
autonomous AI agents contribute to planning, coding, testing, and continuous
learning. To address this methodological gap, we present "Agentsway" a novel
software development framework designed for ecosystems where AI agents operate
as first-class collaborators. Agentsway introduces a structured lifecycle
centered on human orchestration, and privacy-preserving collaboration among
specialized AI agents. The framework defines distinct roles for planning,
prompting, coding, testing, and fine-tuning agents, each contributing to
iterative improvement and adaptive learning throughout the development process.
By integrating fine-tuned LLMs that leverage outputs and feedback from
different agents throughout the development cycle as part of a retrospective
learning process, Agentsway enhances domain-specific reasoning, and explainable
decision-making across the entire software development lifecycle. Responsible
AI principles are further embedded across the agents through the coordinated
use of multiple fine-tuned LLMs and advanced reasoning models, ensuring
balanced, transparent, and accountable decision-making. This work advances
software engineering by formalizing agent-centric collaboration, integrating
privacy-by-design principles, and defining measurable metrics for productivity
and trust. Agentsway represents a foundational step toward the next generation
of AI-native, self-improving software development methodologies. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first research effort to introduce a dedicated
methodology explicitly designed for AI agent-based software engineering teams.

### [4] [RefleXGen:The unexamined code is not worth using](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23674)
*Bin Wang,Hui Li,AoFan Liu,BoTao Yang,Ao Yang,YiLu Zhong,Weixiang Huang,Yanping Zhang,Runhuai Huang,Weimin Zeng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RefleXGen boosts code security in LLM-generated code by combining retrieval augmentation with model self-reflection, showing notable security gains on multiple language models without costly fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address persistent security vulnerabilities in code produced by LLMs, aiming for a resource-efficient technique that does not require extensive fine-tuning or the creation of secure code datasets.

Method: RefleXGen integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation with guided self-reflection mechanisms, allowing LLMs to iteratively self-assess and refine their code generation without relying on costly fine-tuning or specialized datasets.

Result: RefleXGen improves code security across various models, with specific security improvements: 13.6% increase for GPT-3.5 Turbo, 6.7% for GPT-4o, 4.5% for CodeQwen, and 5.8% for Gemini.

Conclusion: Enhancing the self-reflection abilities of large language models is a practical and effective strategy to improve code security in AI-generated outputs.

Abstract: Security in code generation remains a pivotal challenge when applying large
language models (LLMs). This paper introduces RefleXGen, an innovative method
that significantly enhances code security by integrating Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) techniques with guided self-reflection mechanisms inherent in
LLMs. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on fine-tuning LLMs or developing
specialized secure code datasets - processes that can be resource-intensive -
RefleXGen iteratively optimizes the code generation process through
self-assessment and reflection without the need for extensive resources. Within
this framework, the model continuously accumulates and refines its knowledge
base, thereby progressively improving the security of the generated code.
Experimental results demonstrate that RefleXGen substantially enhances code
security across multiple models, achieving a 13.6% improvement with GPT-3.5
Turbo, a 6.7% improvement with GPT-4o, a 4.5% improvement with CodeQwen, and a
5.8% improvement with Gemini. Our findings highlight that improving the quality
of model self-reflection constitutes an effective and practical strategy for
strengthening the security of AI-generated code.

### [5] [TDFlow: Agentic Workflows for Test Driven Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23761)
*Kevin Han,Siddharth Maddikayala,Tim Knappe,Om Patel,Austen Liao,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TDFlow is a new agentic workflow that decomposes repository-scale program repair, leading to major improvements over prior systems on test resolution tasks. It achieves near human-level performance, with the main limitation being reliable test generation. The approach could power future human-LLM collaboration in software engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an increasing need to automate repository-scale software engineering tasks, aiming to solve human-written tests effectively and improve upon existing systems.

Method: TDFlow is proposed as a novel test-driven workflow that divides the program repair process into four sub-agent governed modules: patch proposing, debugging, patch revision, and optional test generation. Each sub-agent tackles a focused sub-task, reducing complexity and enhancing specialization. The workflow operates by repeatedly iterating proposals, revisions, and debugging using engineered tools and strategies, and it focuses on solving human-authored test cases.

Result: TDFlow achieves an 88.8% test pass rate on SWE-Bench Lite, which is 27.8% higher than the next-best system, and a 94.3% pass rate on SWE-Bench Verified. Only 7 out of 800 test runs were flagged for test hacking. The primary challenge identified is in writing successful reproduction tests, not in passing them.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs, when integrated within a tightly engineered and test-driven workflow like TDFlow, can reach human-level software test resolution performance. The major limitation for full autonomy lies in generating valid reproduction tests. A future human-LLM interactive workflow is envisioned, where humans author tests solved by such systems.

Abstract: We introduce TDFlow, a novel test-driven agentic workflow that frames
repository-scale software engineering as a test-resolution task, specifically
designed to solve human-written tests. Given a set of tests, TDFlow repeatedly
proposes, revises, and debugs repository-scale patches using precisely
engineered sub-agents and tightly constrained tools. The workflow decomposes
software engineering program repair into four components governed by respective
sub-agents. This simple, forced decoupling of patch proposing, debugging, patch
revision, and optional test generation (1) reduces long-context burden on any
individual sub-agent, (2) focuses each sub-agent on specific, pre-defined
sub-tasks, and (3) allows for specialized performance improvement on specific
sub-tasks. When provided human-written tests, TDFlow attains 88.8% pass rate on
SWE-Bench Lite (an absolute improvement of 27.8% over the next best system) and
94.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Manual inspection of the 800 TDFlow runs within
SWE-Bench Lite and Verified uncover only 7 instances of test hacking, which
were subsequently counted as failures. Furthermore, we show that the primary
obstacle to human-level software engineering performance lies within writing
successful reproduction tests. We envision a human-LLM interactive system
powered by TDFlow where human developers write tests solved by LLM systems.
Together, these results indicate that modern LLMs, when embedded in a narrowly
engineered, test-driven workflow, already achieve human-level test resolution
-- with the final frontier for fully autonomous repository repair being the
accurate generation of valid reproduction tests.

### [6] [Evaluating the effectiveness of LLM-based interoperability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23893)
*Rodrigo Falcão,Stefan Schweitzer,Julien Siebert,Emily Calvet,Frank Elberzhager*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the ability of large language models to autonomously facilitate system interoperability, focusing on agricultural datasets. qwen2.5-coder:32b achieved the best performance, especially when using the CODEGEN strategy. Full autonomy was not universal, highlighting the need for further research and domain-specific validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing system complexity and heterogeneity, interoperability remains a challenge, both technically and economically. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a possible solution for autonomous system interoperability without ongoing human intervention.

Method: 13 open source LLMs were tested across four versions of a dataset related to agricultural interoperability. Each model underwent three runs per dataset version using two strategic approaches (DIRECT and CODEGEN). Effectiveness and result consistency were compared across models and strategies.

Result: The qwen2.5-coder:32b model was most effective in three out of four dataset versions using both DIRECT (average pass@1 >= 0.99) and CODEGEN (average pass@1 >= 0.89) strategies. For the dataset requiring unit conversion, all models failed using DIRECT, but qwen2.5-coder:32b succeeded using CODEGEN (average pass@1 = 0.75).

Conclusion: Some LLMs, notably qwen2.5-coder:32b, can autonomously enable system interoperability in certain cases. More comprehensive evaluation across domains and research into reliability strategies is advised.

Abstract: Background: Systems of systems are becoming increasingly dynamic and
heterogeneous, and this adds pressure on the long-standing challenge of
interoperability. Besides its technical aspect, interoperability has also an
economic side, as development time efforts are required to build the
interoperability artifacts. Objectives: With the recent advances in the field
of large language models (LLMs), we aim at analyzing the effectiveness of
LLM-based strategies to make systems interoperate autonomously, at runtime,
without human intervention. Method: We selected 13 open source LLMs and curated
four versions of a dataset in the agricultural interoperability use case. We
performed three runs of each model with each version of the dataset, using two
different strategies. Then we compared the effectiveness of the models and the
consistency of their results across multiple runs. Results: qwen2.5-coder:32b
was the most effective model using both strategies DIRECT (average pass@1 >=
0.99) and CODEGEN (average pass@1 >= 0.89) in three out of four dataset
versions. In the fourth dataset version, which included an unit conversion, all
models using the strategy DIRECT failed, whereas using CODEGEN
qwen2.5-coder:32b succeeded with an average pass@1 = 0.75. Conclusion: Some
LLMs can make systems interoperate autonomously. Further evaluation in
different domains is recommended, and further research on reliability
strategies should be conducted.

### [7] [Validating Alerts in Cloud-Native Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23970)
*Maria C. Borges,Julian Legler,Lucca Di Benedetto*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents an extension to the OXN tool that lets reliability engineers rigorously design, validate, and tune alerts early in development, improving alert effectiveness and reducing production issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing effective alerts for reliability engineering is difficult due to the need to balance early fault detection and minimizing false alarms, alongside infrequent code execution for uncommon fault coverage. Existing development lacks rigorous tools for systematic alert validation and testing.

Method: The paper proposes a new alerting extension for the observability experimentation tool OXN. This enables engineers to experiment with, tune, and validate alert rules in the development phase, prior to production deployment.

Result: With the OXN extension, engineers can adjust alerting rules during design and regularly verify their firing behavior, helping prevent future problems and improving reliability of alerting systems.

Conclusion: The alerting extension for OXN allows systematic validation and tuning of alerts, strengthening reliability engineering practices and reducing the risk of undetected faults or false alarms.

Abstract: Observability and alerting form the backbone of modern reliability
engineering. Alerts help teams catch faults early before they turn into
production outages and serve as first clues for troubleshooting. However,
designing effective alerts is challenging. They need to strike a fine balance
between catching issues early and minimizing false alarms. On top of this,
alerts often cover uncommon faults, so the code is rarely executed and
therefore rarely checked. To address these challenges, several industry
practitioners advocate for testing alerting code with the same rigor as
application code. Still, there's a lack of tools that support such systematic
design and validation of alerts.
  This paper introduces a new alerting extension for the observability
experimentation tool OXN. It lets engineers experiment with alerts early during
development. With OXN, engineers can now tune rules at design time and
routinely validate the firing behavior of their alerts, avoiding future
problems at runtime.

### [8] [Lifecycle-Aware code generation: Leveraging Software Engineering Phases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24019)
*Xing Xing,Wei Wang,Lipeng Ma,Weidong Yang,Junjie Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: By aligning code generation with structured software engineering phases and using intermediate artifacts, the proposed framework makes code generated by LLMs significantly more correct and robust—often surpassing single-step methods and even proprietary models when fine-tuned accordingly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code generation systems ignore established software engineering processes, resulting in less-structured and potentially error-prone outputs. The paper aims to bridge data-driven LLM code generation with standard software development best practices to produce more accurate and reliable code.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-step, lifecycle-aligned approach for code generation: it formally incorporates artifacts such as requirements, state machine diagrams, and pseudocode during both training and inference stages. LLMs are fine-tuned using this structure and evaluated by comparing code correctness, CodeBLEU scores, and robustness through ablation studies.

Result: Lifecycle-aware code generation, which incorporates intermediate software engineering artifacts (e.g., requirements analysis, state machine modeling, pseudocode), greatly enhances the effectiveness of LLM-driven code generation. Multi-step inference using these artifacts outperforms traditional single-step code generation, leading to substantial improvements in code correctness and robustness, especially for open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: The lifecycle-aware framework leads to significant improvements in code generation, making open-source LLMs competitive or superior to models pretrained on code with much less training data required. Intermediate artifacts, especially state machine modeling, are key contributors to higher code quality.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has advanced automatic code
generation, yet most approaches rely on direct, single-step translation from
problem descriptions to code, disregarding structured software engineering
practices. We introduce a lifecycle-aware framework that systematically
incorporates intermediate artifacts such as requirements analysis, state
machine modeling, and pseudocode into both the training and inference stages.
This design aligns code generation with standard software development phases
and enables more structured reasoning. Experiments show that lifecycle-level
fine-tuning improves code correctness by up to 75% over the same model before
fine-tuning, with performance gains compounding across intermediate stages.
Multi-step inference consistently surpasses single-step generation,
demonstrating the effectiveness of intermediate scaffolding. Notably,
open-source LLMs, once fine-tuned under our framework, match or slightly
outperform models pretrained on code. When applied to DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B, our
framework yields relative CodeBLEU improvements of 34.3%, 20.0%, 11.2%, and
22.3% over ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and LLaMA-8B,
respectively. Our pipeline also proves robust with up to 80\% less training
data, confirming its resilience. Ablation studies further reveal that each
intermediate artifact contributes distinctly to final code quality, with state
machine modeling yielding the most substantial impact. Our source code and
detailed experimental data are available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Lifecycle-Aware-3CCB.

### [9] [Monitoring and Observability of Machine Learning Systems: Current Practices and Gaps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24142)
*Joran Leest,Ilias Gerostathopoulos,Patricia Lago,Claudia Raibulet*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Through focus groups with ML practitioners, this study mapped real-world approaches to ML observability, highlighted key deficiencies, and called for improved tools and research to strengthen ML system reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Production ML systems often fail silently, leading to incorrect outcomes without clear signals; understanding real-world observability practices is crucial for improving ML system reliability and operation.

Method: The authors conducted seven focus group sessions across multiple domains to empirically investigate what observability information ML practitioners capture and utilize.

Result: The study catalogued systematically captured information by practitioners, mapped its usage for model validation, fault detection, diagnosis, and degradation explanation, and uncovered major areas needing enhancement in tooling and normative practices.

Conclusion: The study reveals significant gaps in current ML observability practices, indicating a need for improved tooling and research to support robust ML operations.

Abstract: Production machine learning (ML) systems fail silently -- not with crashes,
but through wrong decisions. While observability is recognized as critical for
ML operations, there is a lack empirical evidence of what practitioners
actually capture. This study presents empirical results on ML observability in
practice through seven focus group sessions in several domains. We catalog the
information practitioners systematically capture across ML systems and their
environment and map how they use it to validate models, detect and diagnose
faults, and explain observed degradations. Finally, we identify gaps in current
practice and outline implications for tooling design and research to establish
ML observability practices.

### [10] [Investigating Software Aging in LLM-Generated Software Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24188)
*César Santos,Ermeson Andrade,Roberto Natella*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Automatically generated software using LLMs suffers from performance degradation over time, with increased memory use, slower responses, and instability, highlighting the need for aging mitigation strategies and further reliability studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adoption of automatically generated software using Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasing, but there is limited understanding of its long-term reliability. The motivation is to investigate how such code behaves under prolonged usage, specifically in terms of software aging.

Method: Researchers generated four service-oriented applications using LLM-based tools (Bolt platform with Baxbench prompts) and subjected them to 50-hour load tests. They continuously monitored resource usage, response time, and throughput to detect aging-related performance degradation.

Result: The study found significant signs of software aging in all tested applications, such as progressive memory growth, increased response time, and unstable performance. Severity of aging depended on the application type.

Conclusion: Automatically generated software by LLMs shows measurable software aging during sustained operation, pointing to reliability concerns and the need for future research into mitigation techniques and long-term evaluation.

Abstract: Automatically generated software, especially code produced by Large Language
Models (LLMs), is increasingly adopted to accelerate development and reduce
manual effort. However, little is known about the long-term reliability of such
systems under sustained execution. In this paper, we experimentally investigate
the phenomenon of software aging in applications generated by LLM-based tools.
Using the Bolt platform and standardized prompts from Baxbench, we generated
four service-oriented applications and subjected them to 50-hour load tests.
Resource usage, response time, and throughput were continuously monitored to
detect degradation patterns. The results reveal significant evidence of
software aging, including progressive memory growth, increased response time,
and performance instability across all applications. Statistical analyzes
confirm these trends and highlight variability in the severity of aging
according to the type of application. Our findings show the need to consider
aging in automatically generated software and provide a foundation for future
studies on mitigation strategies and long-term reliability evaluation.

### [11] [MAGNET: A Multi-Graph Attentional Network for Code Clone Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24241)
*Zixian Zhang,Takfarinas Saber*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MAGNET, a new multi-graph neural framework, greatly improves code clone detection by combining AST, CFG, and DFG representations with attention mechanisms, achieving best-in-class accuracy and confirming the value of multi-graph fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve code clone detection, which is vital for several software engineering tasks like refactoring, debugging, plagiarism detection, and vulnerability analysis. Traditional methods rely on singular representations that miss out on many semantic features, and hybrid fusion strategies are often handcrafted and suboptimal.

Method: The method proposed is MAGNET, a multi-graph attentional framework that utilizes AST, CFG, and DFG representations of code. It incorporates residual graph neural networks, node-level self-attention, a gated cross-attention mechanism for inter-graph interactions, and Set2Set pooling to combine multi-graph embeddings into comprehensive program representations.

Result: MAGNET demonstrates significant improvements, achieving an overall F1 score of 96.5% on BigCloneBench and 99.2% on Google Code Jam. Ablation studies show that both multi-graph fusion and attentional components are crucial for its success.

Conclusion: MAGNET sets a new state-of-the-art for code clone detection by effectively integrating multiple graph-based representations with advanced attentional mechanisms, addressing prior limitations in semantic capture and fusion strategies.

Abstract: Code clone detection is a fundamental task in software engineering that
underpins refactoring, debugging, plagiarism detection, and vulnerability
analysis. Existing methods often rely on singular representations such as
abstract syntax trees (ASTs), control flow graphs (CFGs), and data flow graphs
(DFGs), which capture only partial aspects of code semantics. Hybrid approaches
have emerged, but their fusion strategies are typically handcrafted and
ineffective. In this study, we propose MAGNET, a multi-graph attentional
framework that jointly leverages AST, CFG, and DFG representations to capture
syntactic and semantic features of source code. MAGNET integrates residual
graph neural networks with node-level self-attention to learn both local and
long-range dependencies, introduces a gated cross-attention mechanism for
fine-grained inter-graph interactions, and employs Set2Set pooling to fuse
multi-graph embeddings into unified program-level representations. Extensive
experiments on BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam demonstrate that MAGNET
achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall F1 score of 96.5\% and
99.2\% on the two datasets, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the critical
contributions of multi-graph fusion and each attentional component. Our code is

*Sadia Afroz,Zixuan Feng,Katie Kimura,Bianca Trinkenreich,Igor Steinmacher,Anita Sarma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper finds that while generative AI helps developers work faster, it does not clearly improve software quality or developer fulfillment, raising questions about real productivity gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to clarify if and how generative AI tools truly impact productivity in software development, addressing the lack of evidence about their practical effects.

Method: The authors surveyed 415 software practitioners using the SPACE framework, analyzing perceptions of productivity changes with GenAI across several dimensions.

Result: The study found limited overall productivity change, with frequent AI users becoming faster but not necessarily producing better software or feeling more fulfilled.

Conclusion: Generative AI tools do not provide clear overall productivity benefits; developers may work faster, but improvements in quality or satisfaction are uncertain, highlighting a productivity paradox.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools are increasingly being adopted in software
development as productivity aids. However, evidence regarding where and when
these tools actually enhance productivity is unclear. In this paper, we
investigate how GenAI adoption affects different dimensions of developer
productivity. We surveyed 415 software practitioners to capture their
perceptions of productivity changes associated with AI-assisted development
using the SPACE framework - Satisfaction and well-being, Performance, Activity,
Communication and collaboration, and Efficiency and flow. Our results,
disaggregated by frequency of AI usage, reveal limited overall productivity
change, highlighting the productivity paradox in which developers become faster
but do not necessarily create better software or feel more fulfilled.

### [13] [Automatically Benchmarking LLM Code Agents through Agent-Driven Annotation and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24358)
*Lingyue Fu,Bolun Zhang,Hao Guan,Yaoming Zhu,Lin Qiu,Weiwen Liu,Xuezhi Cao,Xunliang Cai,Weinan Zhang,Yong Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRDBench, a scalable and robust project-level benchmark for code agents with structured requirements and diverse evaluation metrics, using agents for both generation and judging. It overcomes annotation cost and metric rigidity issues in existing benchmarks and proves effective in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code agent benchmarks suffer from high annotation costs, need for expert involvement, and limited evaluation (mainly via unit tests), hindering scalable and comprehensive assessment of code agents.

Method: The authors propose an agent-driven benchmark creation pipeline, using human supervision to generate diverse project-level tasks. They introduce PRDBench: a benchmark with 50 real-world Python projects in 20 domains, containing structured requirements, comprehensive evaluation criteria, and reference implementations. They use an Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to assess outputs, covering more evaluation types than just unit tests.

Result: PRDBench offers rich and complex tasks with flexible metrics, efficiently supporting both code agent and evaluation agent assessment. Experiments show its effectiveness and scalability for annotation and evaluation.

Conclusion: PRDBench provides a robust, scalable framework that addresses annotation and evaluation bottlenecks in code agent benchmarks, by leveraging agent-driven creation and flexible multi-type assessment processes.

Abstract: Recent advances in code agents have enabled automated software development at
the project level, supported by large language models (LLMs) and widely adopted
tools. However, existing benchmarks for code agent evaluation face two major
limitations: high annotation cost and expertise requirements, and rigid
evaluation metrics that rely primarily on unit tests. To address these
challenges, we propose an agent-driven benchmark construction pipeline that
leverages human supervision to efficiently generate diverse and challenging
project-level tasks. Based on this approach, we introduce PRDBench, a novel
benchmark comprising 50 real-world Python projects across 20 domains, each with
structured Product Requirement Document (PRD) requirements, comprehensive
evaluation criteria, and reference implementations. PRDBench features rich data
sources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics. We further employ an
Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to score agent outputs, enabling the evaluation of
various test types beyond unit tests. Extensive experiments on PRDBench
demonstrate its effectiveness in assessing the capabilities of both code agents
and evaluation agents, providing a scalable and robust framework for annotation
and evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the boom in LLM-generated software artifacts and the inability of current human or traditional automated evaluation methods to scale effectively, reliably, or capture nuanced qualities.

Method: The authors conduct a literature review of current SE studies involving LLMs for automated evaluation, analyze the limitations of existing approaches, identify key research gaps, and propose a detailed roadmap for future development.

Result: A detailed analysis of current challenges and limitations, key gaps in the research space, and a future-focused roadmap for building robust, scalable, and nuanced LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks for software artifact evaluation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that fostering the research and development of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks is crucial for improving the scalability, reliability, and nuance of software artifact evaluation in the SE domain by 2030.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software
engineering (SE) has revolutionized tasks like code generation, producing a
massive volume of software artifacts. This surge has exposed a critical
bottleneck: the lack of scalable, reliable methods to evaluate these outputs.
Human evaluation is costly and time-consuming, while traditional automated
metrics like BLEU fail to capture nuanced quality aspects. In response, the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm - using LLMs for automated evaluation - has emerged.
This approach leverages the advanced reasoning of LLMs, offering a path toward
human-like nuance at automated scale. However, LLM-as-a-Judge research in SE is
still in its early stages. This forward-looking SE 2030 paper aims to steer the
community toward advancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating LLM-generated software
artifacts. We provide a literature review of existing SE studies, analyze their
limitations, identify key research gaps, and outline a detailed roadmap. We
envision these frameworks as reliable, robust, and scalable human surrogates
capable of consistent, multi-faceted artifact evaluation by 2030. Our work aims
to foster research and adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, ultimately
improving the scalability of software artifact evaluation.

### [15] [CodeWiki: Automated Repository-Level Documentation at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24428)
*Nguyen Hoang Anh,Minh Le-Anh,Bach Le,Nghi D. Q. Bui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents CodeWiki, an open-source tool for automated, holistic repository-level documentation that uses novel techniques to generate both textual and visual documentation. It outperforms prior systems and promotes scalable documentation in multiple programming languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers spend a significant amount of time understanding codebases, but maintaining comprehensive documentation at the repository level is challenging due to complexity and the high degree of manual effort required. Existing LLM-based methods focus mostly on function-level documentation and struggle to capture architectural patterns and cross-module interactions at the repository level.

Method: The paper introduces CodeWiki, an open-source framework designed for holistic repository-level documentation. CodeWiki leverages three main innovations: hierarchical decomposition to maintain architectural context, recursive agentic processing with dynamic task delegation, and synthesis of both textual and visual artifacts such as architecture diagrams and data flows. Additionally, the authors present CodeWikiBench, a benchmark for evaluating repository-level documentation using multi-level rubrics and agentic assessment.

Result: CodeWiki demonstrates strong performance, achieving a 68.79% quality score using proprietary models and 64.80% with open-source alternatives. It outperforms existing closed-source systems, proving its effectiveness in scalable and accurate repository-level documentation.

Conclusion: CodeWiki represents the first open-source approach to comprehensive repository-level documentation, offering both qualitative and quantitative improvements over previous solutions, and enabling scalable documentation across seven programming languages and real-world codebases.

Abstract: Developers spend nearly 58% of their time understanding codebases, yet
maintaining comprehensive documentation remains challenging due to complexity
and manual effort. While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
function-level documentation, they fail at the repository level, where
capturing architectural patterns and cross-module interactions is essential. We
introduce CodeWiki, the first open-source framework for holistic
repository-level documentation across seven programming languages. CodeWiki
employs three innovations: (i) hierarchical decomposition that preserves
architectural context, (ii) recursive agentic processing with dynamic
delegation, and (iii) synthesis of textual and visual artifacts including
architecture diagrams and data flows. We also present CodeWikiBench, the first
repository-level documentation benchmark with multi-level rubrics and agentic
assessment. CodeWiki achieves 68.79% quality score with proprietary models and
64.80% with open-source alternatives, outperforming existing closed-source
systems and demonstrating scalable, accurate documentation for real-world
repositories.

### [16] [The Divine Software Engineering Comedy -- Inferno: The Okinawa Files](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24483)
*Michele Lanza*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper offers a darkly humorous reflection on the future of software engineering, identifying major risks: under-skilled practitioners, lost institutional memory, and uncontrollable technological growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to critically explore and highlight the challenges and existential risks facing the future of software engineering as perceived during the symposium.

Method: The essay is an observational reflection, based loosely on discussions from a symposium, using personal experience, sarcasm, and cynicism as stylistic devices.

Result: The author identifies three major concerns for the future: software developers lacking deep understanding, the field evolving too quickly to retain its lessons, and the uncontrolled increase in technologies.

Conclusion: The future of software engineering is unpredictable and potentially problematic, characterized by a lack of foundational knowledge, rapid evolution that forgets past lessons, and overwhelming technological proliferation.

Abstract: In June 2024 I co-organized the FUture of Software Engineering symposium in
Okinawa, Japan. Me, Andrian Marcus, Takashi Kobayashi and Shinpei Hayashi were
general chairs, Nicole Novielli, Kevin Moran, Yutaro Kashiwa and Masanari Kondo
were program chairs, some members of my group, Carmen Armenti, Stefano
Campanella, Roberto Minelli, were the tables, can't have a room with only
chairs, after all. We invited a crowd of people to discuss what future software
engineering has. FUSE became a 3-day marathon on whether there is actually a
future at all for SE. This essay is a slightly dark take about what I saw at
that event, very loosely based on the discussions that took place, adding some
healthy sarcasm and cynicism, the intellectual salt and pepper I never seem to
run out of. I listened to the brilliant people who gathered to talk about where
we're headed, and distilled three nightmares headed in our direction: software
makers who don't know what they're doing, but get the job done anyway, a field
moving so fast it can't remember its own lessons, and technologies multiplying
like rabbits in Spring. So, let's start. The future, eh? The future of software
engineering looks like a car crash in slow motion: you can see it coming but
you can't look away. The thing is...
