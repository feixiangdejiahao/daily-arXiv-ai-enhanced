Instead of focusing only on one type of information, Bin2Vec combines what a program looks like (its built-in functions, imports, and exports) with how it behaves when it runs (its instructions and memory usage). This gives a more complete picture when deciding whether two programs are similar or not. Bin2Vec represents these different types of information as views that can be inspected separately using easy-to-read charts, and then brings them together into an overall similarity score. Bin2Vec acts as a bridge between binary representations and machine learning techniques by generating feature representations that can be efficiently processed by machine-learning models. We tested Bin2Vec on multiple versions of two well-known Windows programs, PuTTY and 7-Zip. The primary results strongly confirmed that our method compute an optimal and visualization-friendly representation of the analyzed software. For example, PuTTY versions showed more complex behavior and memory activity, while 7-Zip versions focused more on performance-related patterns. Overall, Bin2Vec provides decisions that are both reliable and explainable to humans. Because it is modular and easy to extend, it can be applied to tasks like auditing, verifying software origins, or quickly screening large numbers of programs in cybersecurity and reverse-engineering work."}

We introduce a new class of software engineering agents, empowered by Large Language Models and equipped with beliefs, desires, intentions, and memory to enable human-like reasoning. These agents collaborate with humans and other agents to design, implement, test, and deploy software systems with a level of speed, reliability, and adaptability far beyond the current software development processes. Their coordination and collaboration are governed by norms expressed as deontic modalities - commitments, obligations, prohibitions and permissions - that regulate interactions and ensure regulatory compliance. These innovations establish a scalable, transparent and trustworthy framework for future Human-AI software engineering teams."}

Unlike conventional programs, their execution (i.e., trajectories) is inherently stochastic and adaptive to the problem they are solving. Evaluation of such systems is often outcome-centric, judging their performance based on success or failure at the final step. This narrow focus overlooks detailed insights about such systems, failing to explain how agents reason, plan, act, or change their strategies over time. Inspired by the structured representation of conventional software systems as graphs, we introduce Graphectory to systematically encode the temporal and semantic relations in such software systems. Graphectory facilitates the design of process-centric metrics and analyses to assess the quality of agentic workflows independent of final success.\n  Using Graphectory, we analyze 4000 trajectories of two dominant agentic programming workflows, namely SWE-agent and OpenHands, with a combination of four backbone Large Language Models (LLMs), attempting to resolve SWE-bench Verified issues. Our fully automated analyses reveal that: (1) agents using richer prompts or stronger LLMs exhibit more complex Graphectory, reflecting deeper exploration, broader context gathering, and more thorough validation before patch submission; (2) agents' problem-solving strategies vary with both problem difficulty and the underlying LLM -- for resolved issues, the strategies often follow coherent localization-patching-validation steps, while unresolved ones exhibit chaotic, repetitive, or backtracking behaviors; (3) even when successful, agentic programming systems often display inefficient processes, leading to unnecessarily prolonged trajectories."}

While tools like GitHub Copilot are already in widespread use in interactive settings, automated approaches require a higher level of reliability before being usable in industrial practice. In this paper, we focus on three aspects that directly influence the quality of the results: a) the effect of automated feedback loops, b) the choice of Large Language Model (LLM), and c) the influence of behavior-preserving code changes.\n  We study the effect of these three variables on an automated C-to-Rust translation system. Code translation from C to Rust is an attractive use case in industry due to Rust's safety guarantees. The translation system is based on a generate-and-check pattern, in which Rust code generated by the LLM is automatically checked for compilability and behavioral equivalence with the original C code. For negative checking results, the LLM is re-prompted in a feedback loop to repair its output. These checks also allow us to evaluate and compare the respective success rates of the translation system when varying the three variables.\n  Our results show that without feedback loops LLM selection has a large effect on translation success. However, when the translation system uses feedback loops the differences across models diminish. We observe this for the average performance of the system as well as its robustness under code perturbations. Finally, we also identify that diversity provided by code perturbations can even result in improved system performance."}

However, they are hard to program, leading developers to use vendor-provided kernel libraries that support tensor accelerators. As a result, the usage of tensor accelerators is limited to the provided interface, mainly designed for traditional ML and scientific computing workloads.\n  In this paper, we show that tensor accelerators can improve the performance of applications beyond simple variants of MatMul. For example, many image processing pipelines are linear transformations over matrices in disguise and can therefore utilize such specialized hardware. This is nonetheless hindered by the difficulties in programming tensor accelerators. We tackle this problem with compiler-based techniques. We use the Halide user-schedulable language and express operations as Halide algorithms succinctly. To this end, we implement a flexible tensor instruction selector based on equality saturation. The tensor instruction selector supports both CPU- and GPU-attached tensor accelerators and works with existing scheduling operations (e.g., producer-consumer fusion). Together, this enables developers to write diverse accelerator-leveraging applications in a few dozen lines.\n  Using our system, we demonstrate the potential of tensor accelerators beyond their traditional domains. We implement several image processing pipelines (e.g., filtering, resampling, and denoising) in our system and evaluate them against non-accelerator-leveraging baselines. We show that these pipelines can achieve significant speedups. For example, a downsampling routine is sped up by $6.1\\times$ by utilizing Tensor Cores on an Nvidia RTX 4070 GPU."}

Indeed, SPL engineering can significantly impact a company's development process and often requires changes to established developer practices. The work presented in this paper stems from a collaboration with a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) that decided to migrate its existing code base into an SPL. In this study, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of the company's current development processes and practices, as well as the anticipated benefits and risks associated with the migration. Key stakeholders involved in software development participated in this evaluation to provide insight into their perceptions of the migration and their potential resistance to change. This paper describes the design of the interviews conducted with these stakeholders and presents an analysis of the results. Among the qualitative findings, we observed that all participants, regardless of their role in the development process, identified benefits of the migration relevant to their own activities. Furthermore, our results suggest that an effective risk mitigation strategy involves keeping stakeholders informed and engaged throughout the process, preserving as many good practices as possible, and actively involving them in the migration to ensure a smooth transition and minimize potential challenges."}

Developers need detailed data on the energy consumption of their software to mitigate consumption issues. Previous approaches have a broader focus, such as on specific functions or programs, rather than source code statements. They primarily focus on estimating the CPU's energy consumption using point estimates, thereby disregarding other hardware effects and limiting their use for statistical reasoning and explainability. We developed a novel methodology to address the limitations of measuring only the CPU's consumption and using point estimates, focusing on predicting the energy usage of statically typed JVM-based programming languages, such as Java and Scala. We measure the energy consumption of Bytecode patterns, the translation from the programming language's source code statement to their Java Bytecode representation. With the energy measurements, we construct a statistical model using Bayesian statistics, which allows us to predict the energy consumption through statistical distributions and analyze individual factors. The model includes three factors we obtain statically from the code: data size, data type, operation, and one factor about the hardware platform the code executes on: device. To validate our methodology, we implemented it for Java and evaluated its energy predictions on unseen programs. We observe that all four factors are influential, notably that two devices of the same model may differ in energy consumption and that the operations and data types cause consumption differences. The experiments also show that the energy prediction of programs closely follows the program's real energy consumption, validating our approach. Our work presents a methodology for constructing an energy model that future work, such as verification tools, can use for their energy estimates."}

Challenges such as low data maturity, lack of governance, misalignment between technical and business teams, and the absence of structured mechanisms to address ethical and sociotechnical risks have been widely identified in the literature. In this context, the purpose of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of the main risk management methodologies applied to data science projects, aiming to identify, classify, and synthesize their similarities, differences and existing gaps. An integrative literature review was performed using indexed databases and a structured protocol for selection and content analysis. The study examines widely adopted risk management standards ISO 31000, PMBOK Risk Management and NIST RMF, as well as frameworks specific to data science workflows, such as CRISP DM and the recently proposed DS EthiCo RMF, which incorporates ethical and sociotechnical dimensions into the project life cycle. The findings reveal that traditional approaches provide limited coverage of emerging risks, whereas contemporary models propose multidimensional structures capable of integrating ethical oversight, governance and continuous monitoring. As a contribution, this work offers theoretical support for the development of hybrid frameworks that balance technical efficiency, organizational alignment and responsible data practices, while highlighting research gaps that can guide future investigations."}

Lumos is an imperative probabilistic programming DSL over graphs, with constructs to generate independent and identically distributed prompts for LMS. It offers a structured view of prompt distributions via graphs, forming random prompts from sampled subgraphs. Lumos supports certifying LMS for arbitrary prompt distributions via integration with statistical certifiers. We provide hybrid (operational and denotational) semantics for Lumos, providing a rigorous way to interpret the specifications. Using only a small set of composable constructs, Lumos can encode existing LMS specifications, including complex relational and temporal specifications. It also facilitates specifying new properties - we present the first safety specifications for vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving scenarios developed with Lumos. Using these, we show that the state-of-the-art VLM Qwen-VL exhibits critical safety failures, producing incorrect and unsafe responses with at least 90% probability in right-turn scenarios under rainy driving conditions, revealing substantial safety risks. Lumos's modular structure allows easy modification of the specifications, enabling LMS certification to stay abreast with the rapidly evolving threat landscape. We further demonstrate that specification programs written in Lumos enable finding specific failure cases exhibited by state-of-the-art LMS. Lumos is the first systematic and extensible language-based framework for specifying and certifying LMS behaviors, paving the way for a wider adoption of LMS certification."}

This approach promises to democratize software development, but its educational implications remain underexplored. This paper reports on a one-day educational hackathon investigating how novice programmers and mixed-experience teams engage with vibe coding. We organized an inclusive event at a Brazilian public university with 31 undergraduate participants from computing and non-computing disciplines, divided into nine teams. Through observations, an exit survey, and semi-structured interviews, we examined creative processes, tool usage patterns, collaboration dynamics, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal that vibe coding enabled rapid prototyping and cross-disciplinary collaboration, with participants developing prompt engineering skills and delivering functional demonstrations within time constraints. However, we observed premature convergence in ideation, uneven code quality requiring rework, and limited engagement with core software engineering practices. Teams adopted sophisticated workflows combining multiple AI tools in pipeline configurations, with human judgment remaining essential for critical refinement. The short format (9 hours) proved effective for confidence-building among newcomers while accommodating participants with limited availability. We conclude that vibe coding hackathons can serve as valuable low-stakes learning environments when coupled with explicit scaffolds for divergent thinking, critical evaluation of AI outputs, and realistic expectations about production quality."}

As a result, they readily internalize buggy or mislabeled code. Since non-trivial semantic properties are undecidable in general, the only practical way to obtain ground-truth functionality is by dynamic observation of executions. In prior work, we addressed representation with Sequence Sheets, Stimulus-Response Matrices (SRMs), and Stimulus-Response Cubes (SRCs) to capture and compare behavior across tests, implementations, and contexts. These structures make observation data analyzable offline and reusable, but they do not by themselves provide persistence, evolution, or interactive analytics at scale. In this paper, therefore, we introduce observation lakehouses that operationalize continual SRCs: a tall, append-only observations table storing every actuation (stimulus, response, context) and SQL queries that materialize SRC slices on demand. Built on Apache Parquet + Iceberg + DuckDB, the lakehouse ingests data from controlled pipelines (LASSO) and CI pipelines (e.g., unit test executions), enabling n-version assessment, behavioral clustering, and consensus oracles without re-execution. On a 509-problem benchmark, we ingest $\\approx$8.6M observation rows ($<$51MiB) and reconstruct SRM/SRC views and clusters in $<$100ms on a laptop, demonstrating that continual behavior mining is practical without a distributed cluster of machines. This makes behavioral ground truth first-class alongside other run-time data and provides an infrastructure path toward behavior-aware evaluation and training.

Several formula-based fault localisation (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs/circuits with multiple faults.\n  This paper introduces CFaults, a novel fault localisation tool for C software and Boolean circuits with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localisation procedure. Experimental results on three benchmark sets, two of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, and one of Boolean circuits, ISCAS85, show that CFaults is faster at localising faults in C software than other FBFL approaches such as BugAssist, SNIPER, and HSD. On the ISCAS85 benchmark, CFaults is generally slower than HSD; however, it localises faults in only 6% fewer circuits, demonstrating that it remains competitive in this domain. Furthermore, CFaults produces only subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses (e.g., BugAssist and SNIPER)."}

An interplay between constraints, tinkering, and frequency-dependent selection drives the complex evolutionary trajectories of these socio-technological systems. Our approach integrates agent-based modeling and case studies, drawing on complex network analysis and evolutionary theory to explore how software evolves under the competing forces of novelty generation and imitation. By examining the evolution of programming languages and their impact on developer practices, we illustrate how technological artifacts co-evolve with and shape societal norms, cultural dynamics, and human interactions. This ecological perspective also informs our analysis of the emerging role of AI-driven development tools in software evolution. While large language models (LLMs) provide unprecedented access to information, their widespread adoption introduces new evolutionary pressures that may contribute to cultural stagnation, much like the decline of diversity in past software ecosystems. Understanding the evolutionary pressures introduced by AI-mediated software production is critical for anticipating broader patterns of cultural change, technological adaptation, and the future of software innovation."}
