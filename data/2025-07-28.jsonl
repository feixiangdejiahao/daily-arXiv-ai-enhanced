At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores\nsuccessful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor\nAgent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and\nrefining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that\nguides the self-repair loop.

It bypasses the need for explicit\ndependency graph construction and achieving superior slicing accuracy.\nConcretely, SliceMate integrates three specialized agents: (1) a synthesis\nagent that produces candidate slices by incrementally expanding the scan scope\nacross functions and files guided by LLM-inferred dependencies; (2) a\nverification agent that performs conciseness and completeness checks of the\ncandidate slices, detecting missing or irrelevant statements; and (3) a\nrefinement agent that repairs the slices with minimal edits in accordance with\nthe verification results.

Due to the high\nreliability and availability requirements of connected vehicles, it is crucial\nto resolve any occurring failures quickly. To achieve this however, a complex\ncloud/edge architecture with a mesh of dependencies must be navigated to\ndiagnose the responsible root cause. As such, manual analyses become unfeasible\nsince they would significantly delay the troubleshooting.\n  To address this challenge, this paper presents SDVDiag, an extensible\nplatform for the automated diagnosis of connected vehicle functions. The\nplatform enables the creation of pipelines that cover all steps from initial\ndata collection to the tracing of potential root causes. In addition, SDVDiag\nsupports self-adaptive behavior by the ability to exchange modules at runtime.\nDependencies between functions are detected and continuously updated, resulting\nin a dynamic graph view of the system. In addition, vital system metrics are\nmonitored for anomalies. Whenever an incident is investigated, a snapshot of\nthe graph is taken and augmented by relevant anomalies. Finally, the analysis\nis performed by traversing the graph and creating a ranking of the most likely\ncauses.\n  To evaluate the platform, it is deployed inside an 5G test fleet environment\nfor connected vehicle functions. The results show that injected faults can be\ndetected reliably. As such, the platform offers the potential to gain new\ninsights and reduce downtime by identifying problems and their causes at an\nearly stage."}

The conflicts can result from overlapping edits in programs\n(i.e., textual conflicts) or cause build and test errors (i.e., build and test\nconflicts). They degrade software quality and hinder programmer productivity.\nWhile several tools detect build conflicts, few offer meaningful support for\nresolving cases like those caused by method removal. To overcome limitations of\nexisting tools, we introduce BUCOR (Build Conflict Resolver), a new conflict\nresolver. BUCOR first detects conflicts by comparing three versions related to\na merging scenario: base b, left l, and right r. To resolve conflicts, it\nemploys two complementary strategies: example-based transformation (BUCOR-E)\nand rule-based transformation (BUCOR-R). BUCOR-R applies predefined rules to\nhandle common, well-understood conflicts. BUCOR-E mines branch versions (l and\nr) for exemplar edits applied to fix related build errors. From these examples,\nit infers and generalizes program transformation patterns to resolve more\ncomplex conflicts.\n  We evaluated BUCOR on 88 real-world build conflicts spanning 21 distinct\nconflict types. BUCOR generated at least one solution for 65 cases and\ncorrectly resolved 43 conflicts. We observed that this hybrid\napproach--combining context-aware, example-based learning with structured,\nrule-based resolution--can effectively help resolve conflicts. Our research\nsheds light on future directions for more intelligent and automated merge\ntools."}

The\nlack of a unified integration environment further complicates development, as\nconnected mobility solutions are often built in isolation. To ensure reliable\noperations across heterogeneous systems, a dynamic orchestration of functions\nthat considers hardware and software variability is essential. This paper\npresents an open-source CI/CD pipeline tailored for SDVs. It automates the\nbuild, test, and deployment phases using a combination of containerized\nopen-source tools, creating a standardized, portable, and scalable ecosystem\naccessible to all stakeholders. Additionally, a custom OTA middleware\ndistributes software updates and supports rollbacks across vehicles and backend\nservices. Update variants are derived based on deployment target dependencies\nand hardware configurations. The pipeline also supports continuous development\nand deployment of AI models for autonomous driving features. Its effectiveness\nis evaluated using an automated valet parking (AVP) scenario involving\nTurtleBots and a coordinating backend server. Two object detection variants are\ndeveloped and deployed to match hardware-specific requirements. Results\ndemonstrate seamless OTA updates, correct variant selection, and successful\norchestration across all targets. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a\nscalable and efficient solution for managing software variants and OTA updates\nin SDVs, contributing to the advancement of future mobility technologies."}

In this paper, we take a first step\ntowards using ACL2s to reason about Python code by developing an embedding of a\nsubset of the Python type system in ACL2s. The subset of Python types we\nsupport includes many of the most commonly used type annotations as well as\nuser-defined types comprised of supported types. We provide ACL2s definitions\nof these types, as well as defdata enumerators that are customized to provide\ncode coverage and identify errors in Python programs. Using the ACL2s\nembedding, we can generate instances of types that can then be used as inputs\nto fuzz Python programs, which allows us to identify bugs in Python code that\nare not detected by state-of-the-art Python type checkers. We evaluate our work\nagainst four open-source repositories, extracting their type information and\ngenerating inputs for fuzzing functions with type signatures that are in the\nsupported subset of Python types. Note that we only use the type signatures of\nfunctions to generate inputs and treat the bodies of functions as black boxes.\nWe measure code coverage, which ranges from about 68% to more than 80%, and\nidentify code patterns that hinder coverage such as complex branch conditions\nand external file system dependencies. We conclude with a discussion of the\nresults and recommendations for future work."}
