We develop a logic-first treatment of XML prompting that\nunifies (i) grammar-constrained decoding, (ii) fixed-point semantics over\nlattices of hierarchical prompts, and (iii) convergent human-AI interaction\nloops. We formalize a complete lattice of XML trees under a refinement order\nand prove that monotone prompt-to-prompt operators admit least fixed points\n(Knaster-Tarski) that characterize steady-state protocols; under a task-aware\ncontraction metric on trees, we further prove Banach-style convergence of\niterative guidance. We instantiate these results with context-free grammars\n(CFGs) for XML schemas and show how constrained decoding guarantees\nwell-formedness while preserving task performance. A set of multi-layer\nhuman-AI interaction recipes demonstrates practical deployment patterns,\nincluding multi-pass \"plan $\\to$ verify $\\to$ revise\" routines and agentic tool\nuse. We provide mathematically complete proofs and tie our framework to recent\nadvances in grammar-aligned decoding, chain-of-verification, and programmatic\nprompting."}

Software enables rapid\niterations and continuous delivery of new functionality that meets the\never-changing expectations of users. As high-speed development requires\ndiscipline, rigor, and automation, software factories are used. These entail\nmethods and tools used for software development, such as build systems and\npipelines. To keep up with the rapid evolution of software, we need to bridge\nthe disconnect in methods and tools between software development and safety\nengineering today. We need to invest more in formality upfront - capturing\nsafety work products in semantically rich models that are machine-processable,\ndefining automatic consistency checks, and automating the generation of\ndocumentation - to benefit later. Transferring best practices from software to\nsafety engineering is worth exploring. We advocate for safety factories, which\nintegrate safety tooling and methods into software development pipelines."}

Existing solutions often require additional context,\nexpensive SMT solvers, or manual intervention to approximate these functions\nthrough symbolic stubs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to\nautomatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic\nexecution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor\nencounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing\nthe function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic\nProgramming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the\nfunction, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow\nthe symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention,\nenabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable. We\ndemonstrate that AutoStub can automatically approximate external functions with\nover 90% accuracy for 55% of the functions evaluated, and can infer\nlanguage-specific behaviors that reveal edge cases crucial for software\ntesting."}

This paper\nintroduces EZR, a novel and modular framework for multi-objective optimization\nthat unifies active sampling, learning, and explanation within a single,\nlightweight pipeline. Departing from conventional wisdom, our Maximum Clarity\nHeuristic demonstrates that using less (but more informative) data can yield\noptimization models that are both effective and deeply understandable. EZR\nemploys an active learning strategy based on Naive Bayes sampling to\nefficiently identify high-quality configurations with a fraction of the labels\nrequired by fully supervised approaches. It then distills optimization logic\ninto concise decision trees, offering transparent, actionable explanations for\nboth global and local decision-making. Extensive experiments across 60\nreal-world datasets establish that EZR reliably achieves over 90% of the\nbest-known optimization performance in most cases, while providing clear,\ncohort-based rationales that surpass standard attribution-based explainable AI\n(XAI) methods (LIME, SHAP, BreakDown) in clarity and utility. These results\nendorse \"less but better\"; it is both possible and often preferable to use\nfewer (but more informative) examples to generate label-efficient optimization\nand explanations in software systems.

Existing methods on\nautomating the Gym environment setup process for real-world issues suffer from\nlow success rates and high overhead. Meanwhile, synthesizing new tasks within\nexisting Gym environments leaves the vast pool of authentic, human-reported\nproblems untapped. To maximize the utilization of existing Gym environments and\nalso the rich data of issue-resolving history on GitHub, we introduce\nSWE-Mirror, a pipeline that distills a real-world issue's semantic essence,\nmirrors it into another repository with a configured Gym environment, and\nre-animates it as a verifiable issue-resolving task. SWE-Mirror reuses existing\nGym environments along with the vast pool of issue-resolving history hosted on\nGitHub to construct a large-scale dataset of mirrored authentic and verifiable\ntasks. Applying SWE-Mirror to 40 repositories across 4 languages, we have\ncurated a dataset with 60,671 issue-resolving tasks and demonstrated the value\nof our dataset by training and evaluating coding agents at various scale.\nPost-training experiments show that models trained with the dataset exhibit\nimprovements in issue-resolving capabilities. Furthermore, by extending the\ndataset size to over 12,000 high-quality trajectories, we established a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) among Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct based LLMs on the\nOpenHands agent framework, which increases the resolve rate on\nSWE-Bench-Verified by +21.8% for the 7B model and +46.0% for the 32B model and\nvalidates the effectiveness of our approach."}

Models fare poorly on\nOVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a\ndomain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their\npreferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this\ninference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining\nthe model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in\naddition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert\nknowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC\nconstructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses\nthis lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the\nkey-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating\ndata for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation\nand the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement)\npairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we\npropose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of\nretrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled\nafter the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization\ntasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a\ndifficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models\nby using dynamic expert knowledge effectively."}
