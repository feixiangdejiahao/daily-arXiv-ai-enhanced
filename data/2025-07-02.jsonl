Through a large-scale empirical study, we\nidentify key contexts that are useful for composing variable names.

Process mining has developed advanced approaches for the analysis of\nbusiness processes that may also be used in the context of IoT. Bringing\nprocess mining to IoT requires an event abstraction step to lift the low-level\nsensor data to the business process level. In this work, we aim to empower\ndomain experts to perform this step using a newly developed domain-specific\nlanguage (DSL) called Radiant. Radiant supports the specification of patterns\nwithin the sensor data that indicate the execution of higher level process\nactivities.
