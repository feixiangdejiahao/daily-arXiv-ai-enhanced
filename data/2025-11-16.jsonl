Our framework provides an input language of recurrences over logical tensors, which then gets lowered into an intermediate language of recurrences over logical iteration spaces, and finally into programs of send, receive, and computation operations specific to each individual processor. In Cyclotron's IR, programs are optimized such that external memory interactions are confined to the boundaries of the iteration space. Within inner iteration spaces, all data accesses become local: data accesses target values residing in local fast memory or on neighboring processing units, avoiding costly memory movement. We provide a scheduling language allowing users to define how data gets streamed and broadcasted between processors, enabling pipelined execution of computation kernels over distributed topologies of processing elements. We demonstrate the portability of our approach by compiling our IR to a reconfigurable simulator of systolic arrays and chiplet style distributed hardware, as well as to distributed-memory CPU clusters. In the simulated reconfigurable setting, we use our compiler for hardware design space exploration in which link costs and latencies can be specified. In the distributed CPU setting, we show how to use recurrences and our scheduling language to express various matrix multiplication routines (Cannon, SUMMA, PUMMA, weight stationary) and solvers (Triangular solve and Cholesky). For matrix multiplication and the triangular solve, we generate distributed implementations competitive with ScaLAPACK."}

This makes inference predictable and efficient. Unfortunately, many extensions of ML (GADTs, higher-rank polymorphism, and static overloading) endanger princpality by introducing _fragile_ constructs that resist principal inference. Existing approaches recover principality through directional inference algorithms, which propagate _known_ type information in a fixed (or static) order (e.g. as in bidirectional typing) to disambiguate such constructs. However, the rigidity of a static inference order often causes otherwise well-typed programs to be rejected.\n  We propose _omnidirectional_ type inference, where type information flows in a dynamic order. Typing constraints may be solved in any order, suspending when progress requires known type information and resuming once it becomes available, using _suspended match constraints_. This approach is straightforward for simply typed systems, but extending it to ML is challenging due to let-generalization. Existing ML inference algorithms type let-bindings (let x = e1 in e2) in a fixed order: type e1, generalize its type, and then type e2. To overcome this, we introduce _incremental instantiation_, allowing partially solved type schemes containing suspended constraints to be instantiated, with a mechanism to incrementally update instances as the scheme is refined.\n  Omnidirectionality provides a general framework for restoring principality in the presence of fragile features. We demonstrate its versatility on two fundamentally different features of OCaml: static overloading of record labels and datatype constructors and semi-explicit first-class polymorphism. In both cases, we obtain a principal type inference algorithm that is more expressive than OCaml's current typechecker."}

However, under the lens of non-strict evaluation, linearity can be further understood semantically, where a syntactic occurrence of a resource does not necessarily entail using that resource when the program is executed. While this distinction has been largely unexplored, it turns out to be inescapable in Haskell's optimising compiler, which heavily rewrites the source program in ways that break syntactic linearity but preserve the program's semantics. We introduce Linear Core, a novel system which accepts the lazy semantics of linearity statically and is suitable for lazy languages such as the Core intermediate language of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. We prove that Linear Core is sound, guaranteeing linear resource usage, and that multiple optimising transformations preserve linearity in Linear Core while failing to do so in Core. We have implemented Linear Core as a compiler plugin to validate the system against linearity-heavy libraries, including linear-base."}

CuTe layouts and Triton linear layouts are widely adopted industry standards. However, these layout systems operate independently with distinct mathematical underpinnings, preventing unified formal analysis and cross-system reasoning. We bridge this gap by introducing a novel approach that leverages the Integer Set Library (ISL) to create a unified mathematical representation for both layout systems through integer set relations, thereby enabling rigorous formal analysis, correctness verification, and the foundation for future cross-system optimization strategies. Our approach models CuTe layouts through integer set relations that encode the transformation from multi-dimensional coordinates to linear indices using stride-based calculations, including sophisticated swizzle operations that perform bit-level manipulations for enhanced memory access patterns. For Triton linear layouts, we construct integer set relations that model the binary vector space transformations where arithmetic operations follow finite field F_2 rules. We implement a complete suite of layout manipulation algorithms for composition, inversion, complement using built-in operations in ISL to ensure mathematical correctness and preserve layout semantics. Experimental evaluation shows that the system handles the full spectrum of layout complexity, from elementary identity transformations to sophisticated multi-dimensional tensor arrangements with complex stride configurations and swizzle patterns, validating the mathematical modeling approach across different layout paradigms."}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate software development, most studies focus on isolated, single-agent function-level generation. This work examines how process structure and role specialization shape multi-agent LLM workflows for class-level code generation. We simulate a Waterfall-style development cycle covering Requirement, Design, Implementation, and Testing using three LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat, and Claude-3.5-Haiku) on 100 Python tasks from the ClassEval benchmark. Our findings show that multi-agent workflows reorganize, rather than consistently enhance, model performance. Waterfall-style collaboration produces cleaner and more maintainable code but often reduces functional correctness (-37.8\\% for GPT-4o-mini and -39.8\\% for DeepSeek-Chat), with Claude-3.5-Haiku as a notable exception (+9.5\\%). Importantly, process constraints shift failure characteristics: structural issues such as missing code decrease, while semantic and validation errors become more frequent. Among all stages, Testing exerts the strongest influence by improving verification coverage but also introducing new reasoning failures, whereas Requirement and Design have comparatively modest effects. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence that software process structure fundamentally alters how LLMs reason, collaborate, and fail, revealing inherent trade-offs between rigid workflow discipline and flexible problem-solving in multi-agent code generation."}

Implementing these two steps separately duplicates logic that must precisely match to avoid catastrophic security flaws. We address this shortcoming with zkStruDul, a language that unifies input transformations and predicate definitions into a single combined abstraction from which a compiler can project both procedures, eliminating duplicate code and problematic mismatches. zkStruDul provides a high-level abstraction to layer on top of existing NIZK technology and supports important features like recursive proofs. We provide a source-level semantics and prove its behavior is identical to the projected semantics, allowing straightforward standard reasoning."}

EnvTrace is demonstrated with a beamline control-logic digital twin to facilitate the evaluation of instrument control code, with the digital twin itself also enabling the pre-execution validation of live experiments. Over 30 LLMs were evaluated using trace alignment to generate a multi-faceted score for functional correctness across key behavioral dimensions, showing that many top-tier models can approach human-level performance in rapid control-code generation. This is a first step toward a broader vision where LLMs and digital twins work symbiotically: LLMs providing intuitive control and agentic orchestration, and digital twins offering safe and high-fidelity environments, paving the way towards autonomous embodied AI."}

Evaluation of AI agents typically involves using a fixed set of benchmarks and computing multiple evaluation metrics for the agent. While sufficient for simple coding tasks, these benchmarks fall short for enterprise-scale agents, where services and requirements evolve continuously and ground-truth examples are sparse. We propose a process of benchmark generation that helps evolve the benchmarks as the requirements change and perform robust evaluation of evolving AI agents. We instantiate this approach for a case study of service migration from one deployment platform to another at a large public enterprise. Our approach relies on semi-structured documents where developers express the high-level intent, and uses state-of-the-art LLMs to generate benchmarks from just a small number of such documents. Overall, this process results in a maintainable evaluation framework, enabling rapid feedback on agent performance and facilitating targeted improvements."}

However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investigations: a systematic review of 108 papers, two industry workshops with practitioners from multiple organizations, and an empirical analysis of patching real-world software issues using three LLMs. Motivated by insights from both the literature and practitioners, the empirical study examined the quality of generated patches on security, maintainability, and performance efficiency. Across the literature, we found that security and performance efficiency dominate academic attention, while maintainability and other qualities are understudied. In contrast, industry experts prioritize maintainability and readability, warning that generated code may accelerate the accumulation of technical debt. In our evaluation of functionally correct patches generated by three LLMs, improvements in one quality dimension often come at the cost of others. Runtime and memory results further show high variance across models and optimization strategies. Overall, our findings reveal a mismatch between academic focus, industry priorities, and model performance, highlighting the urgent need to integrate quality assurance mechanisms into LLM code generation pipelines to ensure that future generated code not only passes tests but truly passes with quality."}

This overload of alerts leads to ``alert fatigue'', a phenomenon where developers become desensitized to warnings, potentially overlooking critical issues and ultimately hindering productivity and code quality. Analyzing these warnings and training machine learning models to identify and filter them requires substantial datasets, which are currently scarce, particularly for Java. This scarcity impedes efforts to improve the accuracy and usability of SCA tools and mitigate the effects of alert fatigue. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel methodology for collecting and categorizing SCA warnings, effectively distinguishing actionable from non-actionable ones. We further leverage this methodology to generate a large-scale dataset of over 1 million entries of Java source code warnings, named NASCAR: (Non-)Actionable Static Code Analysis Reports. To facilitate follow-up research in this domain, we make both the dataset and the tools used to generate it publicly available."}

Generating diverse SMT solutions helps uncover faults and detect safety violations during the verification and testing process, resulting in the SMT sampling problem, i.e., constructing a small number of solutions while achieving comprehensive coverage of the constraint space. While high coverage is crucial for exploring system behaviors, reducing the number of solutions is of great importance, as excessive solutions increase testing time and resource usage, undermining efficiency. In this work, we introduce PanSampler, a novel SMT sampler that achieves high coverage with a small number of solutions. It incorporates three novel techniques, i.e., diversity-aware SMT algorithm, abstract syntax tree (AST)-guided scoring function and post-sampling optimization technology, enhancing its practical performance. It iteratively samples solutions, evaluates candidates, and employs local search to refine solutions, ensuring high coverage with a small number of samples. Extensive experiments on practical benchmarks demonstrate that PanSampler exhibits a significantly stronger capability to reach high target coverage, while requiring fewer solutions than current samplers to achieve the same coverage level. Furthermore, our empirical evaluation on practical subjects, which are collected from real-world software systems, shows that PanSampler achieves higher fault detection capability and reduces the number of required test cases from 32.6\\% to 76.4\\% to reach the same fault detection effectiveness, leading to a substantial improvement in testing efficiency. PanSampler advances SMT sampling, reducing the cost of software testing and hardware verification."}
