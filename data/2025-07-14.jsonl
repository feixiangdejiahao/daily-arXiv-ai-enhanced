This allows us to give precise resource\nannotations to many higher-order functions that cannot be adequately typed in\nany other system. Inspired by the Dialectica translation, our typing discipline\nis obtained by embedding linear logic into dependent type theory and specifying\nhow the embedded logic interacts with the host theory. We can then use a\nstandard natural numbers type to obtain a quantitative typing system with\ndependent multiplicities. We characterise the semantics for our theory as a\ncombination of standard models of dependent type theory and linear logic. Our\nsystem can be added to any dependently typed language, which we demonstrate\nwith an implementation in Agda."}

This is a tricky question to answer in general, as any function\nmatching the outputs on those examples can in principle be a correct\nextrapolant. We argue that a \"good\" extrapolant should follow certain kinds of\nrules, and here we study a particularly appealing criterion for rule-following\nin list functions: that the function should behave predictably even when\ncertain elements are removed. In functional programming, a standard way to\nexpress such removal operations is by using a filter function. Accordingly, our\npaper introduces a new semantic class of functions -- the filter equivariant\nfunctions. We show that this class contains interesting examples, prove some\nbasic theorems about it, and relate it to the well-known class of map\nequivariant functions. We also present a geometric account of filter\nequivariants, showing how they correspond naturally to certain simplicial\nstructures. Our highlight result is the amalgamation algorithm, which\nconstructs any filter-equivariant function's output by first studying how it\nbehaves on sublists of the input, in a way that extrapolates perfectly."}

To\nachieve this, we conduct several experiments on eight datasets that have been\nmeticulously labeled in prior research.

Floating-point errors can lead to severe consequences.\nAlthough floating-point errors widely exist, only a subset of inputs may\ntrigger significant errors in floating-point programs. Therefore, it is crucial\nto determine whether a given input could produce such errors. Researchers tend\nto take the results of high-precision floating-point programs as oracles for\ndetecting floating-point errors, which introduces two main limitations: (1)\ndifficulty of implementation and (2) prolonged execution time. The two recent\ntools, ATOMU and FPCC, can partially address these issues. However, ATOMU\nsuffers from false positives; while FPCC, though eliminating false positives,\noperates at a considerably slower speed.\n  To address these two challenges, we propose a novel approach named\nPI-detector to computing floating-point errors effectively and efficiently. Our\napproach is based on the observation that floating-point errors stem from large\ncondition numbers in atomic operations (such as addition and subtraction),\nwhich then propagate and accumulate. PI-detector injects small perturbations\ninto the operands of individual atomic operations within the program and\ncompares the outcomes of the original program with the perturbed version to\ncompute floating-point errors. We evaluate PI-detector with datasets from ATOMU\nand HSED, as well as a complex linear system-solving program.

However, when the system operates in dynamic\nenvironments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates\nwill inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,\nwhich reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and\nlocal drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,\nexisting offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to\nthese implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration\nperformance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online\nconfiguration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to\nthese drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the\nlocal and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper\nlevel, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the\nlocal model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the\nlower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and\nadapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA\ncombines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize\nredundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight\nsoftware systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA\nachieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with\nup to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to\nimprove different local models in handling concept drift."}
