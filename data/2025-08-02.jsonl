This has multiple\napplications in program analysis (e.g. cost analysis, loop acceleration,\ndeclarative language analysis) and in hybrid systems governed by differential\nequations.\n  Our main contribution is a new family of constraint-based abstract domains\nfor abstracting numerical functions, B-bound domains, which abstract a function\nf by a conjunction of bounds from a preselected set of boundary functions. They\nallow inferring highly non-linear numerical invariants, which classical\nnumerical abstract domains struggle with. We uncover a convexity property in\nthe constraint space that simplifies, and, in some cases, fully automates,\ntransfer function design.\n  We also introduce domain abstraction, a functor that lifts arbitrary mappings\nin value space to Galois connections in function space. This supports\nabstraction from symbolic to numerical functions (i.e. size abstraction), and\nenables dimensionality reduction of equations.\n  We base our constructions of transfer functions on a simple operator\nlanguage, starting with sequences, and extending to more general functions,\nincluding multivariate, piecewise, and non-discrete domains."}

The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the\nmanagement of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it\nrequires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT\nintegration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device\nfunctions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code\ngeneration. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it\nfirst generates device control logic by progressively retrieving\ndevice-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code\nusing platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a\nmulti-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT\ndevice testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires\nonly binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We\nevaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT\nplatforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average\nsuccess rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any\nhuman involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code\nis then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15\nparticipants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by\n50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use\ncommercial code LLMs."}

To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive\nmulti-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and\nachieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates\nmultiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a\ncode dependency graph.

This structured competition enables agents to\ncollaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated\nfix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch\ngeneration.
