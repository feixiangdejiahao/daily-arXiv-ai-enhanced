This highlights the need to ensure their failure-free\nperformance. One effective method for evaluating failure-free performance is\nweb form testing, where defining effective test scenarios is key to a complete\nand accurate evaluation. A core aspect of this process involves filling form\nfields with suitable values to create effective test cases. However, manually\ngenerating these values is time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this,\nvarious tools have been developed to assist testers. With the appearance of\nlarge language models (LLMs), a new generation of tools seeks to handle this\ntask more intelligently. Although many LLM-based tools have been introduced, as\nthese models typically rely on cloud infrastructure, their use in testing\nconfidential web forms raises concerns about unintended data leakage and\nbreaches of confidentiality. This paper introduces a privacy-preserving\nrecommender that operates locally using a large language model. The tool\nassists testers in web form testing by suggesting effective field values.

However, there are three major\nissues that hinder further progress: how to deal with API authentication; how\nto catalog and compare different fault types found by different fuzzers; and\nwhat to use as case study to facilitate fair comparisons among fuzzers. To\naddress these important challenges, we present Web Fuzzing Commons (WFC) and\nWeb Fuzzing Dataset (WFD). WFC is a set of open-source libraries and schema\ndefinitions to declaratively specify authentication info and catalog different\ntypes of faults that fuzzers can automatically detect. WFD is a collection of\n36 open-source APIs with all necessary scaffolding to easily run experiments\nwith fuzzers, supported by WFC. To show the usefulness of WFC/WFD, a set of\nexperiments is carried out with EvoMaster, a state-of-the-art fuzzer for Web\nAPIs. However, any fuzzer can benefit from WFC and WFD. We compare EvoMaster\nwith other state-of-the-art tools such as ARAT-RL, EmRest, LLamaRestTest,\nRESTler, and Schemathesis.

However, numerous\naccident reports show that ADSs still encounter challenges in complex\nscenarios. As a result, scenario-based testing has become essential for\nidentifying defects and ensuring reliable performance. In particular,\nreal-world accident reports offer valuable high-risk scenarios for more\ntargeted ADS testing. Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on\nvisual data, which demands large memory and manual annotation. Additionally,\nsince existing methods do not adopt standardized scenario formats (e.g.,\nOpenSCENARIO), the generated scenarios are often tied to specific platforms and\nADS implementations, limiting their scalability and portability. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Txt2Sce, a method for generating test scenarios in\nOpenSCENARIO format based on textual accident reports. Txt2Sce first uses a LLM\nto convert textual accident reports into corresponding OpenSCENARIO scenario\nfiles. It then generates a derivation-based scenario file tree through scenario\ndisassembly, scenario block mutation, and scenario assembly. By utilizing the\nderivation relationships between nodes in the scenario tree, Txt2Sce helps\ndevelopers identify the scenario conditions that trigger unexpected behaviors\nof ADSs. In the experiments, we employ Txt2Sce to generate 33 scenario file\ntrees, resulting in a total of 4,373 scenario files for testing the open-source\nADS, Autoware.
