### [1] [Internal Vulnerabilities, External Threats: A Grounded Framework for Enterprise Open Source Risk Governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25882)
*Wenhao Yang,Minghui Zhou,Daniel Izquierdo Cortázar,Yehui Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Traditional technical risk management is insufficient for open source risks in enterprises. The paper proposes a validated, holistic risk governance framework that enables organizations to address both external threats and internal vulnerabilities, moving from reactive to proactive risk management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises face increasingly complex and systemic risks when deeply integrating open source, which are poorly addressed by traditional technical risk management tools. There is a pressing need for a holistic approach that considers both external threats and internal vulnerabilities.

Method: A grounded theory study was conducted with 15 practitioners to develop the holistic risk governance framework. The framework was then validated by three industry experts through retrospective case studies on real-world incidents.

Result: The study delivers an analytical framework (OTVM chain), a Strategic Objectives Matrix, dual taxonomy of external threats and internal vulnerabilities, and an actionable mitigation framework. These collectively offer a systematic model for enterprises to shift from reactive to proactive risk governance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that traditional risk management approaches in enterprises are inadequate to address the complex risks of deep open source integration, and proposes a holistic risk governance framework that enables organizations to proactively build resilience against systemic threats.

Abstract: Enterprise engagement with open source has evolved from tactical adoption to
strategic deep integration, exposing them to a complex risk landscape far
beyond mere code. However, traditional risk management, narrowly focused on
technical tools, is structurally inadequate for systemic threats like upstream
"silent fixes", community conflicts, or sudden license changes, creating a
dangerous governance blind spot. To address this governance vacuum and enable
the necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,
we conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a
holistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical
framework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External
Threat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a
critical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an
undefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the
impact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical
chain: "Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation" (OTVM). This
provides a holistic decision model that transcends mere technical checklists.
Based on this logic, our contributions are: (1) a "Strategic Objectives Matrix"
to clarify goals; (2) a systematic dual taxonomy of External Threats (Ex-Tech,
Ex-Comm, Ex-Eco) and Internal Vulnerabilities (In-Strat, In-Ops, In-Tech); and
(3) an actionable mitigation framework mapping capability-building to these
vulnerabilities. The framework's analytical utility was validated by three
industry experts through retrospective case studies on real-world incidents.
This work provides a novel diagnostic lens and a systematic path for
enterprises to shift from reactive "firefighting" to proactively building an
organizational "immune system".

### [2] [PRISM: Proof-Carrying Artifact Generation through LLM x MDE Synergy and Stratified Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25890)
*Tong Ma,Hui Lai,Hui Wang,Zhenhu Tian,Jizhou Wang,Haichao Wu,Yongfan Gao,Chaochao Li,Fengjie Xu,Ling Fang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PRISM is a framework that merges LLMs and model-driven engineering to automate the creation of compliant, auditable artifacts, using unified semantic models and constraint enforcement. Evaluations show its effectiveness in technical and legal domains, reducing the need for manual checks while ensuring regulatory compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated generation of regulator-ready and machine-checkable artifacts in safety- and compliance-critical domains is challenging. There is a need for integrating LLMs with rigorous model-driven approaches to ensure both ease of artifact creation and regulatory assurance.

Method: PRISM integrates Large Language Models with Model-Driven Engineering using three main components: a Unified Meta-Model for semantic reconciliation, an Integrated Constraint Model for compiling requirements into enforcement mechanisms (GBNF, DFA, SHACL, SMT), and Constraint-Guided Verifiable Generation using two-layer enforcement. It repairs violations and tracks generation traces for compliance.

Result: PRISM was evaluated in domains such as automotive software (AUTOSAR) and cross-border legal jurisdictions (Brussels I bis). It successfully generated structurally valid, auditable artifacts compatible with existing tools and reduced manual remediation.

Conclusion: PRISM demonstrates a practical approach to automated, regulator-ready artifact generation by combining LLMs with rigorous model-driven engineering, offering built-in assurance and substantial reduction in manual effort.

Abstract: PRISM unifies Large Language Models with Model-Driven Engineering to generate
regulator-ready artifacts and machine-checkable evidence for safety- and
compliance-critical domains. PRISM integrates three pillars: a Unified
Meta-Model (UMM) reconciles heterogeneous schemas and regulatory text into a
single semantic space; an Integrated Constraint Model (ICM) compiles structural
and semantic requirements into enforcement artifacts including generation-time
automata (GBNF, DFA) and post-generation validators (e.g., SHACL, SMT); and
Constraint-Guided Verifiable Generation (CVG) applies these through two-layer
enforcement - structural constraints drive prefix-safe decoding while
semantic/logical validation produces machine-checkable certificates. When
violations occur, PRISM performs audit-guided repair and records generation
traces for compliance review. We evaluate PRISM in automotive software
engineering (AUTOSAR) and cross-border legal jurisdiction (Brussels I bis).
PRISM produces structurally valid, auditable artifacts that integrate with
existing tooling and substantially reduce manual remediation effort, providing
a practical path toward automated artifact generation with built-in assurance.

### [3] [A Process Mining-Based System For The Analysis and Prediction of Software Development Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25935)
*Antía Dorado,Iván Folgueira,Sofía Martín,Gonzalo Martín,Álvaro Porto,Alejandro Ramos,John Wallace*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeSight combines GitHub activity tracking, process mining, and LSTM-based prediction to accurately forecast pull-request deadlines, helping teams spot potential overdue issues early and manage workflows more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anticipating deadline breaches early in software development is crucial for proactive project management and workflow optimization.

Method: CodeSight collects development and deployment data from GitHub, transforms it into process mining logs, extracts metrics, and uses an LSTM model to predict PR resolution times.

Result: CodeSight system achieves high precision and F1 scores in predicting deadline compliance, providing actionable insights into PR activities and workflow efficiency.

Conclusion: Integrating process mining and machine learning yields highly accurate predictions of deadline compliance in software development workflows.

Abstract: CodeSight is an end-to-end system designed to anticipate deadline compliance
in software development workflows. It captures development and deployment data
directly from GitHub, transforming it into process mining logs for detailed
analysis. From these logs, the system generates metrics and dashboards that
provide actionable insights into PR activity patterns and workflow efficiency.
Building on this structured representation, CodeSight employs an LSTM model
that predicts remaining PR resolution times based on sequential activity traces
and static features, enabling early identification of potential deadline
breaches. In tests, the system demonstrates high precision and F1 scores in
predicting deadline compliance, illustrating the value of integrating process
mining with machine learning for proactive software project management.

### [4] [Beyond Synthetic Benchmarks: Evaluating LLM Performance on Real-World Class-Level Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26130)
*Musfiqur Rahman,SayedHassan Khatoonabadi,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs are good at function-level synthetic code but fail at real-world class-level tasks; retrieval and better docstrings help a bit, but major limitations remain in context handling and software engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel at function-level code tasks, their class-level performance—key for realistic software development—is poorly understood and potentially overestimated by synthetic benchmarks. This motivates a real-world evaluation.

Method: The paper introduces a benchmark with real-world classes from open-source repositories, divided into seen and unseen groups to test generalization. It evaluates various LLMs under different input specs, retrieval augmentation, and levels of documentation.

Result: LLMs achieve high correctness (84-89%) on synthetic benchmarks but much lower rates (25-34%) on realistic class-level tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation with partial documentation offers some improvements. Main errors are attribute/type mismatches and assertion issues. Comprehensive docstrings yield minimal gains.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show strong performance on synthetic benchmarks but struggle significantly on real-world class-level code generation, highlighting severe limitations in authentic software scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced code generation at the function
level, yet their ability to produce correct class-level implementations in
authentic software projects remains poorly understood. This work introduces a
novel benchmark derived from open-source repositories, comprising real-world
classes divided into seen and unseen partitions to evaluate generalization
under practical conditions. The evaluation examines multiple LLMs under varied
input specifications, retrieval-augmented configurations, and documentation
completeness levels.
  Results reveal a stark performance disparity: LLMs achieve 84% to 89%
correctness on established synthetic benchmarks but only 25% to 34% on
real-world class tasks, with negligible differences between familiar and novel
codebases. Comprehensive docstrings yield modest gains of 1% to 3% in
functional accuracy, though statistical significance is rare.
Retrieval-augmented generation proves most effective with partial
documentation, improving correctness by 4% to 7% by supplying concrete
implementation patterns absent from specifications. Error profiling identifies
AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes (84% of
cases), with synthetic tests overemphasizing assertion issues and real-world
scenarios highlighting type and attribute mismatches. Retrieval augmentation
reduces logical flaws but can introduce dependency conflicts.
  The benchmark and analysis expose critical limitations in current LLM
capabilities for class-level engineering, offering actionable insights for
enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval
integration in production code assistance tools.

### [5] [Reduction of Test Re-runs by Prioritizing Potential Order Dependent Flaky Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26171)
*Hasnain Iqbal,Zerina Begum,Kazi Sakib*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a way to identify and prioritize flaky, order-dependent tests by analyzing shared static fields, greatly reducing the need for repeated test executions and improving the efficiency of CI pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flaky tests, especially order-dependent (OD) tests, compromise the reliability of automated software testing. Existing methods for OD test detection require excessive test re-runs, creating inefficiency and resource waste. The authors are motivated by the need to prioritize likely OD tests, thus reducing unnecessary test executions.

Method: The paper introduces a method to prioritize potential order-dependent tests by analyzing shared static fields in test classes, thereby identifying tests with higher likelihood of order dependency before running them.

Result: The experimental evaluation on 27 project modules found the method successfully prioritized all OD tests in 23 cases, reduced test executions by an average of 65.92%, and unnecessary re-runs by 72.19%.

Conclusion: Prioritizing OD tests using static field analysis in test classes greatly improves OD test detection efficiency, lowers execution costs, and reduces test reruns, making automated testing pipelines more reliable.

Abstract: Flaky tests can make automated software testing unreliable due to their
unpredictable behavior. These tests can pass or fail on the same code base on
multiple runs. However, flaky tests often do not refer to any fault, even
though they can cause the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to fail. A
common type of flaky test is the order-dependent (OD) test. The outcome of an
OD test depends on the order in which it is run with respect to other test
cases. Several studies have explored the detection and repair of OD tests.
However, their methods require re-runs of tests multiple times, that are not
related to the order dependence. Hence, prioritizing potential OD tests is
necessary to reduce the re-runs. In this paper, we propose a method to
prioritize potential order-dependent tests. By analyzing shared static fields
in test classes, we identify tests that are more likely to be order-dependent.
In our experiment on 27 project modules, our method successfully prioritized
all OD tests in 23 cases, reducing test executions by an average of 65.92% and
unnecessary re-runs by 72.19%. These results demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves the efficiency of OD test detection by lowering
execution costs.

### [6] [CHCVerif: A Portfolio-Based Solver for Constrained Horn Clauses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26431)
*Mihály Dobos-Kovács,Levente Bajczi,András Vörös*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CHCVERIF is a portfolio CHC solver utilizing software verification tools, proving especially viable for bitvector-heavy benchmarks and highlighting a promising route for CHC solving research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) are foundational in many verification tasks, but solving CHCs effectively—especially those with challenging features like bitvectors—remains difficult. Mature software verification tools may offer untapped value for this domain.

Method: The paper introduces CHCVERIF, a portfolio-based CHC solver that harnesses established software verification tools to address CHC benchmarks, particularly those with bitvectors and low-level aspects.

Result: CHCVERIF shows only moderate effectiveness with linear integer arithmetic CHC benchmarks but achieves modest success on benchmarks with bitvectors. It demonstrates that using software verification tools as CHC solvers is both viable and potentially promising, especially in a well-designed portfolio setting.

Conclusion: Leveraging software verification tools within a portfolio-based framework (CHCVERIF) is a promising direction for CHC solving, showing particular utility for benchmarks involving low-level semantics like bitvectors.

Abstract: Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) are widely adopted as intermediate
representations for a variety of verification tasks, including safety checking,
invariant synthesis, and interprocedural analysis. This paper introduces
CHCVERIF, a portfolio-based CHC solver that adopts a software verification
approach for solving CHCs. This approach enables us to reuse mature software
verification tools to tackle CHC benchmarks, particularly those involving
bitvectors and low-level semantics. Our evaluation shows that while the method
enjoys only moderate success with linear integer arithmetic, it achieves modest
success on bitvector benchmarks. Moreover, our results demonstrate the
viability and potential of using software verification tools as backends for
CHC solving, particularly when supported by a carefully constructed portfolio.

### [7] [The "4W+1H" of Software Supply Chain Security Checklist for Critical Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26174)
*Liming Dong,Sung Une Lee,Zhenchang Xing,Muhammad Ejaz Ahmed,Stefan Avgoustakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper reviews security practices for software supply chains in critical infrastructure, finds existing frameworks lacking, and offers a checklist to help stakeholders improve security, emphasizing the need for more tailored and integrated solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software supply chain attacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated, posing significant risks to critical infrastructure sectors. Existing security frameworks are inadequate, either being fragmented or not addressing the specific needs of CI sectors.

Method: The authors performed a multivocal literature review involving international frameworks, Australian regulatory sources, and academic studies. They used a '4W+1H' analytical approach to categorize and map software supply chain security practices.

Result: The analysis identified ten core categories of practices, mapped them across phases, stakeholder roles, and implementation levels, culminating in an 80-question checklist for stakeholders. The study found notable gaps between framework guidance and sector-specific needs.

Conclusion: There is a lack of context-aware, integrated security frameworks tailored for critical infrastructure sectors. The proposed checklist aims to help stakeholders better evaluate and enhance software supply chain security, but further integration and customization are needed.

Abstract: The increasing frequency and sophistication of software supply chain attacks
pose severe risks to critical infrastructure sectors, threatening national
security, economic stability, and public safety. Despite growing awareness,
existing security practices remain fragmented and insufficient, with most
frameworks narrowly focused on isolated life cycle stages or lacking alignment
with the specific needs of critical infrastructure (CI) sectors. In this paper,
we conducted a multivocal literature review across international frameworks,
Australian regulatory sources, and academic studies to identify and analyze
security practices across the software supply chain, especially specific CI
sector. Our analysis found that few existing frameworks are explicitly tailored
to CI domains. We systematically leveraged identified software supply chain
security frameworks, using a "4W+1H" analytical approach, we synthesized ten
core categories (what) of software supply chain security practices, mapped them
across life-cycle phases (when), stakeholder roles (who), and implementation
levels (how), and examined their coverage across existing frameworks (where).
Building on these insights, the paper culminates in structured, multi-layered
checklist of 80 questions designed to relevant stakeholders evaluate and
enhance their software supply chain security. Our findings reveal gaps between
framework guidance and sector-specific needs, highlight the need for
integrated, context-aware approaches to safeguard critical infrastructure from
evolving software supply chain risks.

### [8] [A Research Roadmap for Augmenting Software Engineering Processes and Software Products with Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26275)
*Domenico Amalfitano,Andreas Metzger,Marco Autili,Tommaso Fulcini,Tobias Hey,Jan Keim,Patrizio Pelliccione,Vincenzo Scotti,Anne Koziolek,Raffaela Mirandola,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a rigorously developed roadmap for how Generative AI will transform software engineering by 2030, identifying key areas of GenAI augmentation, research challenges, and making ten future predictions, all grounded in validated multi-source evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI is rapidly changing software engineering practices, making it crucial to understand and systematically address how GenAI is transforming SE processes, products, and future research directions.

Method: The paper uses a design science research methodology, conducting three iterative cycles: collaborative workshop discussions, rapid literature reviews, and peer feedback. McLuhan's tetrads are applied as a framework to analyze GenAI’s impact on SE.

Result: The roadmap identifies four key forms of GenAI augmentation in SE, detailing associated research challenges and opportunities. These are further distilled into actionable future research directions. Validation was conducted through cross-team and peer review.

Conclusion: The study provides a systematic, transparent foundation for understanding and predicting the influence of GenAI on software engineering practices and research, presenting ten predictions for SE by 2030.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE)
practices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software
systems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science
research to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of
three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence,
including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 "Software Engineering
2030" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions
involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to
systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and
software products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of
GenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related
research challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated
into a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a
rigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author
teams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation
for analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for
framing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these
findings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.

### [9] [Empowering RepoQA-Agent based on Reinforcement Learning Driven by Monte-carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26287)
*Guochang Li,Yuchen Liu,Zhen Qin,Yunkun Wang,Jianping Zhong,Chen Zhi,Binhua Li,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RepoSearch-R1 uses MCTS-based reinforcement learning to enable repository question-answering agents that outperform baseline methods in completeness and efficiency, while avoiding compliance issues commonly found in distillation-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for repository-level software engineering tasks using large language models struggle with efficient tool use, decision-making, and feedback incorporation. Training-free in-context methods lack guidance capabilities, while training-based approaches depend on costly distillation processes and raise data compliance issues, especially for enterprise use.

Method: The authors propose RepoSearch-R1, an agentic reinforcement learning framework powered by Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This framework enables agents to self-train by generating diverse reasoning trajectories, without requiring model distillation or external supervision. They build RepoQA-Agent, tailored for repository question-answering, using this framework.

Result: RepoSearch-R1 demonstrates notable improvements: a 16% increase in answer completeness over methods without retrieval, a 19.5% improvement over iterative retrieval, and a 33% boost in training efficiency versus general agentic reinforcement learning techniques. Their cold-start training removes data compliance risks while achieving diverse exploration and comprehensive answers.

Conclusion: RepoSearch-R1 effectively addresses limitations of existing LLM-based solutions for repository-level tasks, offering improved completeness, efficiency, and compliance safety via its agentic reinforcement learning approach.

Abstract: Repository-level software engineering tasks require large language models
(LLMs) to efficiently navigate and extract information from complex codebases
through multi-turn tool interactions. Existing approaches face significant
limitations: training-free, in-context learning methods struggle to guide
agents effectively in tool utilization and decision-making based on
environmental feedback, while training-based approaches typically rely on
costly distillation from larger LLMs, introducing data compliance concerns in
enterprise environments. To address these challenges, we introduce
RepoSearch-R1, a novel agentic reinforcement learning framework driven by
Monte-carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach allows agents to generate
diverse, high-quality reasoning trajectories via self-training without
requiring model distillation or external supervision. Based on RepoSearch-R1,
we construct a RepoQA-Agent specifically designed for repository
question-answering tasks. Comprehensive evaluation on repository
question-answering tasks demonstrates that RepoSearch-R1 achieves substantial
improvements of answer completeness: 16.0% enhancement over no-retrieval
methods, 19.5% improvement over iterative retrieval methods, and 33% increase
in training efficiency compared to general agentic reinforcement learning
approaches. Our cold-start training methodology eliminates data compliance
concerns while maintaining robust exploration diversity and answer completeness
across repository-level reasoning tasks.

### [10] [Environmental Impact of CI/CD Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26413)
*Nuno Saavedra,Alexandra Mendes,João F. Ferreira*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper quantifies the hidden environmental costs of using GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipelines), highlighting significant carbon and water footprints and proposing practical mitigation strategies like better runner placement, stricter job management, and repository optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers use CI/CD pipelines extensively, but they lack information about the environmental impacts (carbon and water footprints) associated with these cloud-based services, as providers rarely publish this data. With cloud computing's environmental effects on the rise, quantifying and understanding these impacts for popular CI/CD services has become urgent.

Method: The authors adapt methodologies from the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework and analyze a large dataset covering 2.2 million GitHub Actions workflow runs across 18,000 repositories. They estimate the environmental impact by calculating carbon and water footprints under different scenarios.

Result: The analysis found that GitHub Actions' carbon footprint in 2024 ranges from 150.5 MTCO2e (optimistic) to 994.9 MTCO2e (pessimistic), with the most likely at 456.9 MTCO2e. The water footprint ranges from 1,989.6 to 37,664.5 kiloliters, with the most likely estimate being 5,738.2 kiloliters. These numbers were contextualized against everyday environmental benchmarks.

Conclusion: GitHub Actions has a substantial carbon and water footprint. Developers and CI/CD stakeholders can reduce this impact by choosing regions with cleaner energy, deactivating unnecessary scheduled runs, timing executions when energy mixes are favorable, and reducing repository sizes. These strategies help to minimize the environmental cost of automated software workflows.

Abstract: CI/CD pipelines are widely used in software development, yet their
environmental impact, particularly carbon and water footprints (CWF), remains
largely unknown to developers, as CI service providers typically do not
disclose such information. With the growing environmental impact of cloud
computing, understanding the CWF of CI/CD services has become increasingly
important.
  This work investigates the CWF of using GitHub Actions, focusing on
open-source repositories where usage is free and unlimited for standard
runners. We build upon a methodology from the Cloud Carbon Footprint framework
and we use the largest dataset of workflow runs reported in the literature to
date, comprising over 2.2 million workflow runs from more than 18,000
repositories.
  Our analysis reveals that the GitHub Actions ecosystem results in a
substantial CWF. Our estimates for the carbon footprint in 2024 range from
150.5 MTCO2e in the most optimistic scenario to 994.9 MTCO2e in the most
pessimistic scenario, while the water footprint ranges from 1,989.6 to 37,664.5
kiloliters. The most likely scenario estimates are 456.9 MTCO2e for carbon
footprint and 5,738.2 kiloliters for water footprint. To provide perspective,
the carbon footprint in the most likely scenario is equivalent to the carbon
captured by 7,615 urban trees in a year, and the water footprint is comparable
to the water consumed by an average American family over 5,053 years.
  We explore strategies to mitigate this impact, primarily by reducing wasted
computational resources. Key recommendations include deploying runners in
regions whose energy production has a low environmental impact such as France
and the United Kingdom, implementing stricter deactivation policies for
scheduled runs and aligning their execution with periods when the regional
energy mix is more environmentally favorable, and reducing the size of
repositories.

### [11] [Nexus: Execution-Grounded Multi-Agent Test Oracle Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26423)
*Dong Huang,Mingzhe Du,Jie M. Zhang,Zheng Lin,Meng Luo,Qianru Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Nexus, a multi-agent framework, improves non-regression test oracle generation through collaborative refinement and validation, outperforming existing methods in accuracy, bug detection, and program repair rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is challenging, as it is difficult to produce oracles that accurately determine whether a program behaves correctly for a given input.

Method: Nexus is introduced as a multi-agent framework. It uses four specialist agents to deliberate and refine test oracles, validates them by executing candidate implementations in a sandbox, and iteratively refines failing oracles using observed errors.

Result: Nexus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in oracle accuracy: for LiveCodeBench, test-level accuracy improves from 46.30% to 57.73%. Bug detection rates and automated program repair success rates also notably increase.

Conclusion: Nexus presents an effective approach to generating highly accurate, self-improving test oracles for non-regression testing, surpassing previous methods in both accuracy and downstream task performance.

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

### [12] [SecureReviewer: Enhancing Large Language Models for Secure Code Review through Secure-aware Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26457)
*Fang Liu,Simiao Liu,Yinghao Zhu,Xiaoli Lian,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SecureReviewer is a novel LLM-based automated code review tool tailored for security issues. With a specialized dataset, knowledge grounding (RAG), and the SecureBLEU metric, it delivers superior security detection and comment quality compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated code review tools are not effective at detecting and addressing security-related issues, mainly due to their general-purpose design, lack of domain-specific datasets, and inadequate evaluation metrics. There is a need for methods that specifically target security concerns during the code review process.

Method: The authors propose SecureReviewer, which fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) on a specially constructed dataset for secure code review. Their method includes a secure-aware fine-tuning strategy, integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for grounding outputs in security knowledge, and introduces SecureBLEU, a metric that measures the effectiveness of comments in addressing security issues.

Result: SecureReviewer, the proposed system, achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines. It generates review comments that are more accurate in detecting security issues and providing practical fix suggestions, as shown by improvements in both detection accuracy and the quality of review comments.

Conclusion: SecureReviewer advances automated code review for security-related issues by leveraging fine-tuned LLMs, RAG for knowledge grounding, and introducing a new evaluation metric (SecureBLEU), demonstrating clear improvements over existing solutions in security issue detection and comment quality.

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

*Sivajeet Chand,Melih Kilic,Roland Würsching,Sushant Kumar Pandey,Alexander Pretschner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that open-source large language models can automate Extract Method Refactoring for Python, particularly when using recursive prompting strategies. These techniques enhance code quality and receive strong developer approval, though automated metrics don’t always match human judgment. The authors provide a benchmark for future research in LLM-powered code refactoring.

Motivation: Extract Method Refactoring (EMR) is critical for improving code readability and maintainability, but its automation still faces significant challenges. Open-source large language models (LLMs) have recently shown potential to automate such high-level programming tasks.

Method: The paper evaluates five open-source LLMs (3B to 8B parameters) on automating EMR for Python code. The study uses automated metrics for functional correctness and code quality, comparing one-shot prompting against a recursive criticism and improvement (RCI) prompting strategy. Additionally, a developer survey assesses the perceived quality of the refactored code.

Result: RCI prompting yields better refactoring results than one-shot approaches: Deepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI achieve test pass rates of 82.9% and 80.8%, respectively. Both models significantly reduce lines of code and cyclomatic complexity per method. Developer survey results show >70% acceptance of RCI-generated refactorings, with Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI rated highest overall. Automated metrics sometimes diverge from human judgment, highlighting the value of human-in-the-loop evaluation.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs, especially when combined with RCI prompting, can effectively automate Extract Method Refactoring, improving code quality and developer acceptance. Human evaluation is essential for aligning automated metrics with subjective assessments. The benchmark introduced serves as a baseline for further research.

Abstract: Automating the Extract Method refactoring (EMR) remains challenging and
largely manual despite its importance in improving code readability and
maintainability. Recent advances in open-source, resource-efficient Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer promising new approaches for automating such
high-level tasks. In this work, we critically evaluate five state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, spanning 3B to 8B parameter sizes, on the EMR task for Python
code. We systematically assess functional correctness and code quality using
automated metrics and investigate the impact of prompting strategies by
comparing one-shot prompting to a Recursive criticism and improvement (RCI)
approach. RCI-based prompting consistently outperforms one-shot prompting in
test pass rates and refactoring quality. The best-performing models,
Deepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI, achieve test pass percentage (TPP)
scores of 0.829 and 0.808, while reducing lines of code (LOC) per method from
12.103 to 6.192 and 5.577, and cyclomatic complexity (CC) from 4.602 to 3.453
and 3.294, respectively. A developer survey on RCI-generated refactorings shows
over 70% acceptance, with Qwen2.5-Coder rated highest across all evaluation
criteria. In contrast, the original code scored below neutral, particularly in
readability and maintainability, underscoring the benefits of automated
refactoring guided by quality prompts. While traditional metrics like CC and
LOC provide useful signals, they often diverge from human judgments,
emphasizing the need for human-in-the-loop evaluation. Our open-source
benchmark offers a foundation for future research on automated refactoring with
LLMs.

### [14] [Envisioning Future Interactive Web Development: Editing Webpage with Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26516)
*Truong Hai Dang,Jingyu Xiao,Yintong Huo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Instruct4Edit, an automated pipeline that generates data to fine-tune models for web code editing, enabling smaller open-source models to achieve high performance for natural language-driven web edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web application development often involves manual and slow iterative code modifications. Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate UI code but struggle with modifying existing code based on new design instructions due to a lack of robust training data.

Method: An automated data generation pipeline leverages LLMs to create diverse instructions and corresponding code modifications, validates changes via visual verification, and uses this synthesized dataset to fine-tune and evaluate models for web editing tasks.

Result: The authors present Instruct4Edit, a pipeline that uses LLMs to automatically synthesize a high-quality dataset for web code editing. Fine-tuning models on this dataset consistently improves model ability to accurately perform code changes from human commands. Fine-tuned open-source models can match proprietary system performance.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source models, using the Instruct4Edit dataset, provide scalable and transparent natural language-based web editing, potentially reducing dependence on proprietary systems. Resources are fully released for reproducibility.

Abstract: The evolution of web applications relies on iterative code modifications, a
process that is traditionally manual and time-consuming. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) can generate UI code, their ability to edit existing code from
new design requirements (e.g., "center the logo") remains a challenge. This is
largely due to the absence of large-scale, high-quality tuning data to align
model performance with human expectations. In this paper, we introduce a novel,
automated data generation pipeline that uses LLMs to synthesize a high-quality
fine-tuning dataset for web editing, named Instruct4Edit. Our approach
generates diverse instructions, applies the corresponding code modifications,
and performs visual verification to ensure correctness. By fine-tuning models
on Instruct4Edit, we demonstrate consistent improvement in translating human
intent into precise, structurally coherent, and visually accurate code changes.
This work provides a scalable and transparent foundation for natural language
based web editing, demonstrating that fine-tuning smaller open-source models
can achieve competitive performance with proprietary systems. We release all
data, code implementations, and model checkpoints for reproduction.

### [16] ["Show Me You Comply... Without Showing Me Anything": Zero-Knowledge Software Auditing for AI-Enabled Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26576)
*Filippo Scaramuzza,Renato Cordeiro Ferreira,Tomaz Maia Suller,Giovanni Quattrocchi,Damian Andrew Tamburri,Willem-Jan van den Heuvel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Traditional methods fail to make AI transparent without leaking proprietary information. This paper introduces ZKMLOps, a framework using Zero-Knowledge Proofs for auditable, confidential AI compliance, and demonstrates its feasibility in finance regulation and various ML model complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems are increasingly used in critical domains, and regulations demand verifiable accountability. Traditional verification and validation methods are often expensive, manual, and unsuitable for black-box AI models, posing a challenge between compliance and protecting proprietary assets.

Method: The paper proposes ZKMLOps, a novel MLOps verification framework that leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in the machine learning lifecycle. ZKMLOps integrates ZKPs with established software engineering patterns to enable modular and repeatable cryptographic proof generation for compliance verification.

Result: The framework's practicality is demonstrated through a finance sector compliance study and empirical evaluation of several leading ZKP protocols, assessing their performance in ML models of varying complexity.

Conclusion: ZKMLOps provides a viable way to assure regulatory compliance in AI-enabled systems using ZKPs, balancing auditability demands with confidentiality of proprietary data and models.

Abstract: The increasing exploitation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems
in critical domains has made trustworthiness concerns a paramount showstopper,
requiring verifiable accountability, often by regulation (e.g., the EU AI Act).
Classical software verification and validation techniques, such as procedural
audits, formal methods, or model documentation, are the mechanisms used to
achieve this. However, these methods are either expensive or heavily manual and
ill-suited for the opaque, "black box" nature of most AI models. An intractable
conflict emerges: high auditability and verifiability are required by law, but
such transparency conflicts with the need to protect assets being audited-e.g.,
confidential data and proprietary models-leading to weakened accountability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces ZKMLOps, a novel MLOps
verification framework that operationalizes Zero-Knowledge Proofs
(ZKPs)-cryptographic protocols allowing a prover to convince a verifier that a
statement is true without revealing additional information-within
Machine-Learning Operations lifecycles. By integrating ZKPs with established
software engineering patterns, ZKMLOps provides a modular and repeatable
process for generating verifiable cryptographic proof of compliance. We
evaluate the framework's practicality through a study of regulatory compliance
in financial risk auditing and assess feasibility through an empirical
evaluation of top ZKP protocols, analyzing performance trade-offs for ML models
of increasing complexity.

### [17] [Online and Interactive Bayesian Inference Debugging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26579)
*Nathanael Nussbaumer,Markus Böck,Jürgen Cito*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a new tool for interactively debugging Bayesian inference in probabilistic programming, greatly reducing the required time and expertise, as verified in a user study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic programming makes Bayesian inference accessible but is challenging when debugging inference issues, often requiring significant expertise and time. There is a need for tools that make debugging Bayesian inference easier and more efficient.

Method: The authors propose a novel debugging framework and tool for Bayesian inference, designed to work directly within a development environment. They define specific requirements for such a framework, then implement and evaluate the tool.

Result: The tool was evaluated with 18 experienced participants. Results show that the approach significantly reduces the time and difficulty required to debug Bayesian inference tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating online and interactive debugging tools for Bayesian inference within the development environment improves efficiency and accessibility for practitioners, making inference debugging faster and less demanding.

Abstract: Probabilistic programming is a rapidly developing programming paradigm which
enables the formulation of Bayesian models as programs and the automation of
posterior inference. It facilitates the development of models and conducting
Bayesian inference, which makes these techniques available to practitioners
from multiple fields. Nevertheless, probabilistic programming is notoriously
difficult as identifying and repairing issues with inference requires a lot of
time and deep knowledge. Through this work, we introduce a novel approach to
debugging Bayesian inference that reduces time and required knowledge
significantly. We discuss several requirements a Bayesian inference debugging
framework has to fulfill, and propose a new tool that meets these key
requirements directly within the development environment. We evaluate our
results in a study with 18 experienced participants and show that our approach
to online and interactive debugging of Bayesian inference significantly reduces
time and difficulty on inference debugging tasks.

### [18] [Stitch: Step-by-step LLM Guided Tutoring for Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26634)
*Yuan Si,Kyle Qi,Daming Li,Hanyuan Shi,Jialu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stitch, an interactive tutoring system for block-based programming that uses a step-by-step approach instead of simply showing students the correct answer. Stitch contrasts students' code with a reference and uses large language models to explain differences and guide partial fixes. Empirical evaluation shows that Stitch's scaffolding improves learning more than current automated feedback tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Block-based programming tools reduce syntax errors but do not address deeper semantic bugs. Existing feedback methods often give away solutions, limiting learning. There is a need for better feedback that fosters problem-solving skills in novices.

Method: The authors developed the Stitch system, which analyzes student code via a Diff-Analyze module, highlights important differences from correct solutions, and uses LLM explanations. They conducted an empirical study comparing Stitch to an existing state-of-the-art automated feedback generator for Scratch.

Result: The study shows that Stitch's iterative, scaffolded tutoring significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art automated feedback and direct answer provision, enhancing learning outcomes for programming novices.

Conclusion: Step-by-step, interactive feedback in block-based programming education leads to greater learning gains than direct answer-based feedback or current automated tools.

Abstract: Block-based environments such as Scratch are increasingly popular in
programming education. While block syntax reduces surface errors, semantic bugs
remain common and challenging for novices to resolve. Existing debugging
workflows typically show the correct program directly to learners, a strategy
that may fix errors but undermines the development of problem-solving skills.
  We present Stitch, an interactive tutoring system that replaces "showing the
answer" with step-by-step scaffolding. The system's Diff-Analyze module
contrasts a student's project with a reference implementation, identifies the
most critical differences, and uses a large language model to explain why these
changes matter. Learners inspect highlighted blocks through a custom rendering
engine, understand the explanations, and selectively apply partial fixes. This
iterative process continues until the intended functionality is achieved.
  We evaluate Stitch in an empirical study, comparing it against a
state-of-the-art automated feedback generation tool for Scratch. Our key
insight is that simply presenting the correct program is pedagogically
ineffective. In contrast, our interactive, step-by-step guided system promotes
a more effective learning experience. More broadly, what constitutes effective
feedback in block-based programming remains an open question. Our evaluation
provides new evidence that step-by-step tutoring significantly enhances
learning outcomes, outperforming both direct-answer approaches and current
automated feedback generation tools.

### [19] [Process-based Indicators of Vulnerability Re-Introducing Code Changes: An Exploratory Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26676)
*Samiha Shimmi,Nicholas M. Synovic,Mona Rahimi,George K. Thiruvathukal*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates why software vulnerabilities reappear even after being fixed, focusing on process metrics rather than just code. Analyzing the ImageMagick project, the authors find that issues in management and team responsiveness often contribute to vulnerability reintroduction. They suggest that combining process and code metrics can help predict and mitigate risky fixes in software development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software vulnerabilities frequently persist or reappear after being fixed, due to the dynamic nature of code evolution and socio-technical factors. Traditional code metrics alone are insufficient to understand or anticipate these vulnerabilities, motivating a closer examination of process metrics and development activities over time.

Method: The study analyzes security fixes at the commit level, focusing on sequences of changes rather than isolated actions. It uses longitudinal software engineering process metrics, including bus factor, issue density, and issue spoilage, to correlate these with instances of vulnerability reintroduction. The researchers conduct a detailed case study on the ImageMagick project, investigating 76 instances of vulnerabilities that were reintroduced.

Result: The findings reveal that vulnerability reintroduction often coincides with increased issue spoilage and varying issue density, suggesting that short-term inefficiencies in issue management and team responsiveness contribute to the problem. These process metrics provide valuable insight into the circumstances leading to vulnerability recurrence.

Conclusion: Process metrics are vital for understanding and predicting the re-emergence of software vulnerabilities. Combining process metrics with code metrics may allow for improved identification of risky development activities and help strengthen software security.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities often persist or re-emerge even after being fixed,
revealing the complex interplay between code evolution and socio-technical
factors. While source code metrics provide useful indicators of
vulnerabilities, software engineering process metrics can uncover patterns that
lead to their introduction. Yet few studies have explored whether process
metrics can reveal risky development activities over time -- insights that are
essential for anticipating and mitigating software vulnerabilities. This work
highlights the critical role of process metrics along with code changes in
understanding and mitigating vulnerability reintroduction. We move beyond
file-level prediction and instead analyze security fixes at the commit level,
focusing not only on whether a single fix introduces a vulnerability but also
on the longer sequences of changes through which vulnerabilities evolve and
re-emerge. Our approach emphasizes that reintroduction is rarely the result of
one isolated action, but emerges from cumulative development activities and
socio-technical conditions. To support this analysis, we conducted a case study
on the ImageMagick project by correlating longitudinal process metrics such as
bus factor, issue density, and issue spoilage with vulnerability reintroduction
activities, encompassing 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities. Our
findings show that reintroductions often align with increased issue spoilage
and fluctuating issue density, reflecting short-term inefficiencies in issue
management and team responsiveness. These observations provide a foundation for
broader studies that combine process and code metrics to predict risky fixes
and strengthen software security.

### [20] [Using Copilot Agent Mode to Automate Library Migration: A Quantitative Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26699)
*Aylton Almeida,Laerte Xavier,Marco Tulio Valente*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLM agents can automate the migration of library APIs but often break application functionality, requiring more advances before fully reliable software maintenance automation is possible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Updating libraries and frameworks in software systems is crucial for avoiding technical debt and security issues but is often difficult and error-prone. Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding systems may help automate this process.

Method: The study uses Github's Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI system, to migrate a popular Python library (SQLAlchemy) across ten client applications. Migration Coverage, a new metric, is introduced to measure the proportion of API usage points that were correctly migrated.

Result: The LLM agent successfully migrated all API usage points in the majority of cases (100% migration coverage, median). However, it was much less successful in maintaining the overall application functionality, as reflected by a low test-pass rate (39.75%, median).

Conclusion: While LLM-powered agents can automate API migrating tasks efficiently, they struggle to preserve application functionality, indicating that further improvements are necessary for robust, automated software maintenance.

Abstract: Keeping software systems up to date is essential to avoid technical debt,
security vulnerabilities, and the rigidity typical of legacy systems. However,
updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone
process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding
systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this
paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy,
across a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's
Copilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing
multi-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated
migration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the
proportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study
show that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages
between SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to
maintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate
(39.75%, median).

### [21] [Optimized Log Parsing with Syntactic Modifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26793)
*Nafid Enan,Gias Uddin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks log parsers, showing syntax-based ones are highly efficient, while semantic-based are best for template identification. Using a two-phase system and adding their SynLog+ module greatly improves parsing accuracy for both types, without extra processing time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the need to improve the accuracy and efficiency of log parsing, which is a critical first step in automated log analysis. With a wide range of log parsers based on different techniques available, understanding their strengths, weaknesses, and comparative performance is essential for optimizing log-based analytics and system insights.

Method: The authors conducted a comprehensive empirical study comparing syntax-based vs. semantic-based log parsers, alongside single-phase and two-phase parsing architectures. They evaluated these parsers' performance on identifying correct log templates, efficiency, and grouping accuracy.

Result: Semantic-based methods outperform in template identification, while syntax-based methods are 10 to 1,000 times more efficient and excel in grouping accuracy but are less accurate in template identification. Two-phase architectures improve accuracy over single-phase ones consistently. The proposed SynLog+ module, used as a second phase, boosts parsing accuracy for syntax-based log parsers by 236% and for semantic-based log parsers by 20%, with virtually no increase in runtime cost.

Conclusion: Two-phase parsing architectures offer improved accuracy in log parsing. While semantic-based methods are superior in identifying templates, syntax-based log parsers offer significant efficiency and grouping accuracy. Adding the SynLog+ module as a second phase dramatically enhances the accuracy of existing log parsers without significant runtime overhead.

Abstract: Logs provide valuable insights into system runtime and assist in software
development and maintenance. Log parsing, which converts semi-structured log
data into structured log data, is often the first step in automated log
analysis. Given the wide range of log parsers utilizing diverse techniques, it
is essential to evaluate them to understand their characteristics and
performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study
comparing syntax- and semantic-based log parsers, as well as single-phase and
two-phase parsing architectures. Our experiments reveal that semantic-based
methods perform better at identifying the correct templates and syntax-based
log parsers are 10 to 1,000 times more efficient and provide better grouping
accuracy although they fall short in accurate template identification.
Moreover, two-phase architecture consistently improves accuracy compared to
single-phase architecture. Based on the findings of this study, we propose
SynLog+, a template identification module that acts as the second phase in a
two-phase log parsing architecture. SynLog+ improves the parsing accuracy of
syntax-based and semantic-based log parsers by 236\% and 20\% on average,
respectively, with virtually no additional runtime cost.

### [22] [Fair intersection of seekable iterators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26016)
*Michael Arntzenius*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper shows that the fairness technique from miniKanren's search strategy can be used to implement optimal join algorithms in a compositional way, using a seekable iterator interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient and fair search and join algorithms are important for both logic programming and database query optimization, motivating the transfer of ideas between these fields.

Method: The authors analyze the fairness achieved in miniKanren through bounded work, and show how this principle maps to compositional join algorithms using a seekable iterator interface.

Result: The authors demonstrate that the bounded work/fairness strategy can lead to worst-case optimal, elegant, and composable join implementations, especially suited for shallow embedding in functional languages.

Conclusion: The bounded work principle from miniKanren can be applied to build efficient and fair join operations, particularly in functional programming environments.

Abstract: miniKanren's key semantic advance over Prolog is to implement a complete yet
efficient search strategy, fairly interleaving execution between disjuncts.
This fairness is accomplished by bounding how much work is done exploring one
disjunct before switching to the next. We show that the same idea -- fairness
via bounded work -- underlies an elegant compositional approach to implementing
worst-case optimal joins using a seekable iterator interface, suitable for
shallow embedding in functional languages.
