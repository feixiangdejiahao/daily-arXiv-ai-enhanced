To this end, scenario-based\ntesting offers a practical solution, and simulation-based methods have gained\ntraction due to the high cost and risk of real-world testing. However,\nevaluating the realism of simulated scenarios remains difficult, creating\ndemand for effective assessment methods. Recent advances show that Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning and generalization\ncapabilities, suggesting their potential in assessing scenario realism through\nscenario-related textual prompts. Motivated by this, we propose DriveRLR, a\nbenchmark tool to assess the robustness of LLMs in evaluating the realism of\ndriving scenarios. DriveRLR generates mutated scenario variants, constructs\nprompts, which are then used to assess a given LLM's ability and robustness in\ndetermining the realism of driving scenarios. We validate DriveRLR on the\nDeepScenario dataset using three state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-5, Llama 4\nMaverick, and Mistral Small 3.2. Results show that DriveRLR effectively reveals\ndifferences in the robustness of various LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness\nand practical value in scenario realism assessment. Beyond LLM robustness\nevaluation, DriveRLR can serve as a practical component in applications such as\nan objective function to guide scenario generation, supporting simulation-based\nADS testing workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces DriveRLR, a benchmarking tool that uses automatically generated scenario variants to assess how well different LLMs can judge the realism of driving scenarios, revealing strengths and weaknesses of popular models and helping improve safety testing for autonomous vehicles.", "motivation": "Ensuring the safety of autonomous driving systems is challenging, especially when relying on simulation-based scenario testing, as measuring the realism of these simulated scenarios is difficult.
