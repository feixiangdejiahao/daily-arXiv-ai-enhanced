In the\nintervening decades, the conversation shifted towards a concurrent line of work\n-- applicative, monadic or arrow-based combinator libraries -- in an effort to\nfind combinators for invertible syntax descriptions that simultaneously\ndetermine a parser as well as a printer, and with more expressive power, able\nto handle inductive structures such as lists and trees. Along the way,\ncontinuation passing got lost. This paper argues that Danvy's insight remains\nas relevant to the general setting as it was to the restricted setting of his\noriginal paper. Like him, we present three solutions that exploit\ncontinuation-passing style as an alternative to both dependent types and\nmonoidal aggregation via nested pairs, in our case to parse and print\nstructured data with increasing expressive power."}

Refactoring improves code quality\nbut is difficult to teach, especially with complex, real-world codebases.\nTraditional methods like code reviews and static analysis tools offer limited,\ninconsistent feedback. Our approach integrates LLM-assisted refactoring into a\ncourse project using structured prompts to help students identify and address\ncode smells such as long methods and low cohesion. Implemented in Spring 2025\nin a long-lived OSS project, the intervention is evaluated through student\nfeedback and planned analysis of code quality improvements. Findings suggest\nthat LLMs can bridge theoretical and practical learning, supporting a deeper\nunderstanding of maintainability and refactoring principles."}

Existing log parsers can be categorized into\nstatistic-based and semantic-based approaches. In comparison to semantic-based\nparsers, existing statistic-based parsers tend to be more efficient, require\nlower computational costs, and be more privacy-preserving thanks to on-premise\ndeployment, but often fall short in their accuracy (e.g., grouping or parsing\naccuracy) and generalizability. Therefore, it became a common belief that\nstatistic-based parsers cannot be as effective as semantic-based parsers since\nthe latter could take advantage of external knowledge supported by pretrained\nlanguage models. Our work, however, challenges this belief with a novel\nstatistic-based parser, PIPLUP. PIPLUP eliminates the pre-assumption of the\nposition of constant tokens for log grouping and relies on data-insensitive\nparameters to overcome the generalizability challenge, allowing \"plug and play\"\non given log files. According to our experiments on an open-sourced large log\ndataset, PIPLUP shows promising accuracy and generalizability with the\ndata-insensitive default parameter set. PIPLUP not only outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art statistic-based log parsers, Drain and its variants, but also\nobtains a competitive performance compared to the best unsupervised\nsemantic-based log parser (i.e., LUNAR). Further, PIPLUP exhibits low time\nconsumption without GPU acceleration and external API usage; our simple,\nefficient, and effective approach makes it more practical in real-world\nadoptions, especially when costs and privacy are of major concerns."}

Prior studies demonstrate that when explicit\ninstructions--such as docstrings--are provided, these models can generate\nhighly accurate implementations. However, in real-world repositories, such\nannotations are frequently absent, and performance drops substantially without\nthem. To address this gap, we frame the task as a three-stage process. The\nfirst stage focuses on intent inference, where the model analyzes the code\npreceding the target function to uncover cues about the desired functionality.\nSuch preceding context often encodes subtle but critical information, and we\ndesign a reasoning-based prompting framework to guide the LLM through\nstep-by-step extraction and synthesis of these signals before any code is\ngenerated. The second stage introduces an optional interactive refinement\nmechanism to handle cases where preceding context alone is insufficient for\nintent recovery. In this stage, the model proposes a small set of candidate\nintentions, enabling the developer to select or edit them so that the inferred\nintent closely matches the actual requirement. Finally, in the third stage, the\nLLM generates the target function conditioned on the finalized intent. To\nsupport this pipeline, we curate a dataset of 40,000 examples annotated with\nintermediate reasoning traces and corresponding docstrings. Extensive\nexperiments on DevEval and ComplexCodeEval show that our approach consistently\nboosts multiple LLMs, achieving over 20\\% relative gains in both\nreference-based and execution-based metrics, with the interactive refinement\nstage delivering additional improvements beyond these gains."}

The process of code review is highly inefficient\nfor several reasons, such as it being a time-consuming process, inconsistent\nfeedback, and review quality not being at par most of the time. Using our\ntelemetry data, we observed that at TATA 1mg, pull request (PR) processing\nexhibits significant inefficiencies, with average pick-up and review times of\n73 and 82 hours, respectively, resulting in a 6.2 day closure cycle. The review\ncycle was marked by prolonged iterative communication between the reviewing and\nsubmitting parties. Research from the University of California, Irvine\nindicates that interruptions can lead to an average of 23 minutes of lost\nfocus, critically affecting code quality and timely delivery. To address these\nchallenges, we developed DeputyDev's PR review capabilities by providing\nautomated, contextual code reviews. We conducted a rigorous double-controlled\nA/B experiment involving over 200 engineers to evaluate DeputyDev's impact on\nreview times. The results demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in\nboth average per PR (23.09%) and average per-line-of-code (40.13%) review\ndurations. After implementing safeguards to exclude outliers, DeputyDev has\nbeen effectively rolled out across the entire organisation. Additionally, it\nhas been made available to external companies as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)\nsolution, currently supporting the daily work of numerous engineering\nprofessionals.
