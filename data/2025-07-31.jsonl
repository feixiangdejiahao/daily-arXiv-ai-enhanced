Recent work, TroVE, argues that code-generating Large Language\nModels (LLMs) can benefit similarly on the MATH benchmark by inducing and\nreusing higher-level toolboxes. By allocating computational budget across an\nensemble of three modes -- directly generating code, creating tools, and\nreusing tools -- TroVE claims to outperform a PRIMITIVE baseline that only\nperforms direct generation. However, recent analysis (Berlot-Attwell et al.,\n2024) casts doubt on these gains, noting that the tools created are often\ntrivial or rarely reused, suggesting that improvements may stem from\nself-consistency or self-correction. In this work, we re-evaluate TroVE on\nMATH, analyze the impact of each of its modes, and show that its benefit does\nnot come from these mechanisms, but simply from a higher computational budget\nspent for TroVE compared to PRIMITIVE. To this end, we also perform a small\ncorrection in the original implementation of TroVE's selection mechanism,\nboosting TroVE's performance on MATH by 3\\% in accuracy.

Metamorphic testing has become a widely\nused approach to evaluate models' robustness by applying semantic-preserving\ntransformations to input programs and analyzing the stability of model outputs.\nWhile prior research has explored testing deep learning models, this systematic\nliterature review focuses specifically on metamorphic testing for deep code\nmodels. By studying 45 primary papers, we analyze the transformations,\ntechniques, and evaluation methods used to assess robustness. Our review\nsummarizes the current landscape, identifying frequently evaluated models,\nprogramming tasks, datasets, target languages, and evaluation metrics, and\nhighlights key challenges and future directions for advancing the field."}

However, the rapid development of this field has resulted in a\nfragmented research landscape, with diverse studies that are difficult to\ncompare due to differences in, e.g., system designs and dataset usage. This\nfragmentation makes it difficult to obtain a clear overview of the\nstate-of-the-art or compare and categorize studies meaningfully. In this work,\nwe present a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of LLM-based\nsoftware vulnerability detection. We analyze 227 studies published between\nJanuary 2020 and June 2025, categorizing them by task formulation, input\nrepresentation, system architecture, and adaptation techniques. Further, we\nanalyze the datasets used, including their characteristics, vulnerability\ncoverage, and diversity. We present a fine-grained taxonomy of vulnerability\ndetection approaches, identify key limitations, and outline actionable future\nresearch opportunities. By providing a structured overview of the field, this\nreview improves transparency and serves as a practical guide for researchers\nand practitioners aiming to conduct more comparable and reproducible research.\nWe publicly release all artifacts and maintain a living repository of LLM-based\nsoftware vulnerability detection studies."}

Designed to learn and act independently,\nthese systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention.\nHowever, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which\nare unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the\ndecision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous\nsystems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When\nmultiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must\nnegotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the\nparties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous\nsystems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into\ntheir decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a\ndomain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable\nof ethic-based negotiating. The paper also presents RobEthiChor-Ros, an\nimplementation of RobEthiChor within the Robot Operating System (ROS), which\ncan be deployed on robots to provide them with ethics-based negotiation\ncapabilities. To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real\nrobots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource\ncontention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness\nof the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor allowed robots\nto reach an agreement in more than 73\\% of the scenarios with an acceptable\nnegotiation time (0.67s on average). Experiments also demonstrate that the\nnegotiation approach implemented in RobEthiChor is scalable."}

The more\nfrequent occurrence of incidents has created a demand for Root Cause\nAnalysis(RCA) methods that enable rapid identification and recovery of\nincidents. Large language model (LLM) provides a new path for quickly locating\nand recovering from incidents by leveraging their powerful generalization\nability combined with expert experience. Current LLM for RCA frameworks are\nbased on ideas like ReAct and Chain-of-Thought, but the hallucination of LLM\nand the propagation nature of anomalies often lead to incorrect localization\nresults. Moreover, the massive amount of anomalous information generated in\nlarge, complex systems presents a huge challenge for the context window length\nof LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose KnowledgeMind, an innovative\nLLM multi-agent system based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and a knowledge base\nreward mechanism for standardized service-by-service reasoning. Compared to\nState-Of-The-Art(SOTA) LLM for RCA methods, our service-by-service exploration\napproach significantly reduces the burden on the maximum context window length,\nrequiring only one-tenth of its size. Additionally, by incorporating a\nrule-based real-time reward mechanism, our method effectively mitigates\nhallucinations during the inference process. Compared to the SOTA LLM for RCA\nframework, our method achieves a 49.29% to 128.35% improvement in root cause\nlocalization accuracy."}

Existing techniques for APR are\noften combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the\ncode-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current\nLLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference\nstage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates\nit through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two\nimportant aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training\nphase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address\nthis, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's\ntraining phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is\nrequired to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish\ndefective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables\nthe model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of\ndefects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with\nthree different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to\nco-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely\nadopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1. Specially,\ncompared to vanilla models, Repair-R1 improves repair success rate by 2.68\\% to\n48.29\\%, test generation success rate by 16.38\\% to 53.28\\%, and test coverage\nby 0.78\\% to 53.96\\%.

While it is a clear\nprinciple that research code, along with other essential outputs, should be\nrecognised as artifacts of the research process, the how of this principle\nremains variable. This study examines where UK academic institutions store and\nregister software as a unique research output, searching the UKRI's Gateway to\nResearch (GtR) metadata for publicly funded research software in the UK. The\nquantity of software reported as research outcomes remains low in proportion to\nother categories. Artifact sharing appears low, with one-quarter of the\nreported software having no links and 45% having either a missing or erroneous\nURL. Of the valid URLs, we find the single largest category is Public\nCommercial Code Repository, with GitHub being the host of 18% of all publicly\nfunded research software listed. These observations are contrasted with past\nfindings from 2023 and finally, we discuss the lack of artifact sharing in UK\nresearch, with resulting implications for the maintenance and evolution of\nresearch software. Without dissemination, research software risks demotion to a\ntransient artifact, useful only to meet short term research demands but\nultimately lost to the broader enterprise of science."}
