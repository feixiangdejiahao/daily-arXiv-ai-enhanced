Phoenix addresses the fragmentation of today's C/C++ pointer analysis ecosystem by cleanly separating IR construction, constraint generation, solver backends, and client-facing queries, making analyses easy to compare, swap, and compose while exposing explicit precision-performance trade-offs. We evaluate Phoenix against SVF under two representative configurations: a flow- and context-insensitive setting and a more precise flow- and context-sensitive setting, on 28 GNU coreutils programs. Phoenix delivers robust speedups in the baseline configuration (up to 2.88x) and remains competitive, and often faster, even in the stronger precision regime (up to 2.91x), without a systematic runtime penalty. In production, Phoenix serves as the analysis substrate for static analysis and fuzzing tools that have uncovered hundreds of new bugs and enabled deployments reporting more than 1000 bugs found in an industrial toolchain."}

Our empirical analysis reveals two key observations: 1) Model performance deteriorates quickly as the number of constraints in the user intent increases, and 2) While user intent does influence the model's logits, such an influence may not be strong enough to effectively steer the decoding process. To this end, we propose Intent-Amplified Code Generation (IntentCoding), a novel decoding strategy that enhances an LLM's ability to follow user intent. IntentCoding captures the influence of user intent by masking out the intent, and applies a multi-strength ensemble mechanism to amplify the effect of user intent during generation. IntentCoding is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and integrates seamlessly with existing decoding procedures. To enable systematic evaluation, we also construct CodeConstraints, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to test user intent compliance under varying numbers of constraints. Experiments on our constructed Constraints, as well as popular IFEvalCode, HumanEval and LiveCodeBench datasets, show that our IntentCoding model significantly improves both constraint satisfaction and functional correctness compared to standard decoding approaches. IntentCoding achieves up to 71.0% relative improvement on CodeConstraints, achieves up to 67.3% relative improvement on IFEvalCode and achieves up to 29.3% relative improvement in pass@1 on HumanEval and LiveCodeBench compared with greedy decoding."}

In this paper, we present an empirical study of AI agent involved fix related PRs, examining both their integration outcomes, latency, and the factors that hinder successful merging. We first analyze 8,106 fix related PRs authored by five widely used AI coding agents from the AIDEV POP dataset to quantify the proportions of PRs that are merged, closed without merging, or remain open. We then conduct a manual qualitative analysis of a statistically significant sample of 326 closed but unmerged PRs, spending approximately 100 person hours to construct a structured catalog of 12 failure reasons. Our results indicate that test case failures and prior resolution of the same issues by other PRs are the most common causes of non integration, whereas build or deployment failures are comparatively rare.

An Empirical Study", "comment": "Accepted for publication at MSR 2026", "summary": "Coding agents have received significant adoption in software development recently. Unlike traditional LLM-based code completion tools, coding agents work with autonomy (e.g., invoking external tools) and leave visible traces in software repositories, such as authoring commits. Among their tasks, coding agents may autonomously generate software tests; however, the quality of these tests remains uncertain. In particular, excessive use of mocking can make tests harder to understand and maintain. This paper presents the first study to investigate the presence of mocks in agent-generated tests of real-world software systems. We analyzed over 1.2 million commits made in 2025 in 2,168 TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python repositories, including 48,563 commits by coding agents, 169,361 commits that modify tests, and 44,900 commits that add mocks to tests. Overall, we find that coding agents are more likely to modify tests and to add mocks to tests than non-coding agents. We detect that (1) 60% of the repositories with agent activity also contain agent test activity; (2) 23% of commits made by coding agents add/change test files, compared with 13% by non-agents; (3) 68% of the repositories with agent test activity also contain agent mock activity; (4) 36% of commits made by coding agents add mocks to tests, compared with 26% by non-agents; and (5) repositories created recently contain a higher proportion of test and mock commits made by agents. Finally, we conclude by discussing implications for developers and researchers. We call attention to the fact that tests with mocks may be potentially easier to generate automatically (but less effective at validating real interactions), and the need to include guidance on mocking practices in agent configuration files."}

The core technical bottleneck originates from the closure mechanisms inherent in TypeScript's dynamic language features and the interaction patterns involving OpenHarmony's framework APIs. Existing static analysis tools for ArkTS struggle to achieve effective tracking and precise deduction of object reference relationships, leading to topological fractures in call graph reachability and diminished analysis coverage. This technical limitation fundamentally constrains the implementation of advanced program analysis techniques.\n  Therefore, in this paper, we propose a tool named ArkAnalyzer Pointer Analysis Kit (APAK), the first context-sensitive pointer analysis framework specifically designed for ArkTS. APAK addresses these challenges through a unique ArkTS heap object model and a highly extensible plugin architecture, ensuring future adaptability to the evolving OpenHarmony ecosystem. In the evaluation, we construct a dataset from 1,663 real-world applications in the OpenHarmony ecosystem to evaluate APAK, demonstrating APAK's superior performance over CHA/RTA approaches in critical metrics including valid edge coverage (e.g., a 7.1% reduction compared to CHA and a 34.2% increase over RTA). The improvement in edge coverage systematically reduces false positive rates from 20% to 2%, enabling future exploration of establishing more complex program analysis tools based on our framework.

A Systematic Study of Logical Constructs in LLM-based Specification Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "Formal specifications play a pivotal role in accurately characterizing program behaviors and ensuring software correctness. In recent years, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for the automatic generation of program specifications has emerged as a promising avenue for enhancing verification efficiency. However, existing research has been predominantly confined to generating specifications based on basic syntactic constructs, falling short of meeting the demands for high-level abstraction in complex program verification. Consequently, we propose incorporating logical constructs into existing LLM-based specification generation framework. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of systematic investigation into whether LLMs can effectively generate such complex constructs. To this end, we conduct an empirical study aimed at exploring the impact of various types of syntactic constructs on specification generation framework. Specifically, we define four syntactic configurations with varying levels of abstraction and perform extensive evaluations on mainstream program verification datasets, employing a diverse set of representative LLMs. Experimental results first confirm that LLMs are capable of generating valid logical constructs. Further analysis reveals that the synergistic use of logical constructs and basic syntactic constructs leads to improvements in both verification capability and robustness, without significantly increasing verification overhead. Additionally, we uncover the distinct advantages of two refinement paradigms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic work exploring the feasibility of utilizing LLMs for generating high-level logical constructs, providing an empirical basis and guidance for the future construction of automated program verification framework with enhanced abstraction capabilities."}

Existing textual code compression methods mitigate this via selective filtering but often disrupt dependency closure, causing semantic fragmentation. To address this, we introduce LongCodeOCR, a visual compression framework that renders code into compressed two-dimensional image sequences for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By preserving a global view, this approach avoids the dependency breakage inherent in filtering. We systematically evaluate LongCodeOCR against the state-of-the-art LongCodeZip across four benchmarks spanning code summarization, code question answering, and code completion.\n  Our results demonstrate that visual code compression serves as a viable alternative for tasks requiring global understanding. At comparable compression ratios ($\\sim$1.7$\\times$), LongCodeOCR improves CompScore on Long Module Summarization by 36.85 points over LongCodeZip. At a 1M-token context length with Glyph (a specialized 9B VLM), LongCodeOCR maintains higher accuracy than LongCodeZip while operating at about 4$\\times$ higher compression. Moreover, compared with LongCodeZip, LongCodeOCR drastically reduces compression-stage overhead (reducing latency from $\\sim$4.3 hours to $\\sim$1 minute at 1M tokens). Finally, our results characterize a fundamental coverage--fidelity trade-off: visual code compression retains broader context coverage to support global dependencies, yet faces fidelity bottlenecks on exactness-critical tasks; by contrast, textual code compression preserves symbol-level precision while sacrificing structural coverage."}

Scratch programs exhibit deeply nested, non-linear structures, event-driven concurrency across multiple sprites, and tight coupling between code and multimedia assets, properties that differ fundamentally from textual code. As a result, LLMs often misinterpret Scratch semantics and generate large, invasive edits that are syntactically valid but semantically incorrect when repairing buggy programs.\n  We introduce ScratchEval, the first executable benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair for Scratch programs, covering program understanding, debugging, analysis, and repair. The benchmark contains 100 curated Scratch projects from the public repository, selected for structural and semantic complexity. Each project is paired with executable test suites, bug descriptions with corresponding fixes, block-level edit constraints defining minimal semantically correct repairs, and required multimedia assets. The benchmark is constructed through a human-in-the-loop pipeline combining automated project mining with expert validation of trigger-outcome semantics and representative bug patterns, with emphasis on event ordering, concurrency, and state management.\n  To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we propose a three-layer executable protocol measuring functional correctness via VM-level execution, repair quality using block-level edit distance and behavioral trajectory comparisons, and explanation quality via structured rubrics assessing alignment between model reasoning and generated patches. Using ScratchEval, we study domain-specific fine-tuning, training data effectiveness, and model generalization to unseen bug types.

Detecting Tests Obsessed by Methods", "comment": "Accepted for publication at ICPC 2026", "summary": "Best testing practices state that tests should verify a single functionality or behavior of the system. Tests that verify multiple behaviors are harder to understand, lack focus, and are more coupled to the production code. An attempt to identify this issue is the test smell \\emph{Eager Test}, which aims to capture tests that verify too much functionality based on the number of production method calls. Unfortunately, prior research suggests that counting production method calls is an inaccurate measure, as these calls do not reliably serve as a proxy for functionality. We envision a complementary solution based on runtime analysis: we hypothesize that some tests that verify multiple behaviors will likely cover multiple paths of the same production methods. Thus, we propose a novel test smell named \\emph{Test Obsessed by Method}, a test method that covers multiple paths of a single production method. We provide an initial empirical study to explore the presence of this smell in 2,054 tests provided by 12 test suites of the Python Standard Library. (1) We detect 44 \\emph{Tests Obsessed by Methods} in 11 of the 12 test suites. (2) Each smelly test verifies a median of two behaviors of the production method.

Yet, it suffers from significant memory and thread-safety issues. Recent studies have explored automated translation of C/C++ to safer languages, such as Rust. However, these studies focused mostly on the correctness and safety of the translated code, which are indeed critical, but they left other important quality concerns (e.g., performance, robustness, and maintainability) largely unexplored. This work investigates strengths and weaknesses of three C-to-Rust translators, namely C2Rust (a transpiler), C2SaferRust (an LLM-guided transpiler), and TranslationGym (an LLM-based direct translation). We perform an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of several important quality attributes for the translated Rust code of the popular GNU coreutils, using human-based translation as a baseline. To assess the internal and external quality of the Rust code, we: (i) apply Clippy, a rule-based state-of-the-practice Rust static analysis tool; (ii) investigate the capability of an LLM (GPT-4o) to identify issues potentially overlooked by Clippy; and (iii) perform a manual analysis of the issues reported by Clippy and GPT-4o. Our results show that while newer techniques reduce some unsafe and non-idiomatic patterns, they frequently introduce new issues, revealing systematic trade-offs that are not visible under existing evaluation practices. Notably, none of the automated techniques consistently match or exceed human-written translations across all quality dimensions, yet even human-written Rust code exhibits persistent internal quality issues such as readability and non-idiomatic patterns. Together, these findings show that translation quality remains a multi-dimensional challenge, requiring systematic evaluation and targeted tool support beyond both naive automation and manual rewriting."}

It achieves high test fidelity by replaying production traffic against a comprehensive library of application-level faults to exercise internal error-handling logic. To manage the combinatorial test space, Cast employs a complexity-driven strategy to systematically prune redundant tests and prioritize high-value tests targeting the most critical service execution paths. Cast automates the testing lifecycle through a three-phase pipeline (i.e., startup, fault injection, and recovery) and uses a multi-faceted oracle to automatically verify system resilience against nuanced criteria. Deployed in Huawei Cloud for over eight months, Cast has been adopted by many service teams to proactively address resilience vulnerabilities. Our analysis on four large-scale applications with millions of traces reveals 137 potential vulnerabilities, with 89 confirmed by developers.

However, existing resource management approaches fail to exploit this structure. Industrial autoscalers like Kubernetes HPA ignore inter-service dependencies, while recent academic methods often assume static topologies, rendering them ineffective under dynamic execution contexts. In this work, we propose Morphis, a dependency-aware provisioning framework that unifies pattern-aware trace analysis with global optimization. It introduces structural fingerprinting that decomposes traces into a stable execution backbone and interpretable deviation subgraphs. Then, resource allocation is formulated as a constrained optimization problem over predicted pattern distributions, jointly minimizing aggregate CPU usage while satisfying end-to-end tail-latency SLOs.

However, these data are scarce, and collecting them for arbitrary pairs of libraries is difficult. Moreover, these migration tools often miss out on leveraging modern code transformation infrastructure.\n  In this paper, we present a new approach to automated API migration that sidesteps the limitations described above.

Next, we use an Agent to generalize those examples to reusable transformation scripts in PolyglotPiranha, a modern code transformation tool.

In this paper, we propose Stream of Revision, a paradigm shift that elevates code generation from a monotonic stream to a dynamic, self-correcting trajectory by leveraging model's intrinsic capabilities. We introduce specific action tokens that enable the model to seamlessly backtrack and edit its own history within a single forward pass.

TraceLLM achieves state-of-the-art F2 scores, outperforming traditional IR baselines, fine-tuned models, and prior LLM-based methods. We also explore the impact of demonstration selection strategies, identifying label-aware, diversity-based sampling as particularly effective. Overall, our findings highlight that traceability performance depends not only on model capacity but also critically on the quality of prompt engineering. In addition, the achieved performance suggests that TraceLLM can support semi-automated traceability workflows in which candidate links are reviewed and validated by human analysts."}

This study evaluates the performance impact of workflow automation using n8n through a small-scale business case study. A representative lead-processing workflow was implemented to automatically store data, send email confirmations, and generate real-time notifications. Experimental benchmarking was conducted by comparing 20 manual executions with 25 automated executions under controlled conditions. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in the average execution time from 185.35 seconds (manual) to 1.23 seconds (automated), corresponding to an approximately 151 times reduction in execution time. Additionally, manual execution exhibited an error rate of 5%, while automated execution achieved zero observed errors. The findings highlight the effectiveness of low-code automation in improving efficiency, reliability, and operational consistency for small-scale workflows."}

This has motivated the use of LLMs offline to improve retrieval, ranking, and recommendation models. Existing solutions typically fine-tune separate LLMs for individual tasks such as query-ad relevance labeling, keyword-based query generation, and user profiling. This results in redundant models, high maintenance cost, and limited performance gains despite substantial overlap in domain knowledge and reasoning patterns. We introduce AdNanny, a unified reasoning-centric LLM that serves as a shared backbone for offline advertising tasks. AdNanny is obtained by fine-tuning a public 671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1 checkpoint using a scalable training system that supports hybrid dense-MoE parallelism. We construct reasoning-augmented corpora that pair structured supervision with step-by-step natural language explanations. A multi-task supervised fine-tuning stage with adaptive reweighting enables AdNanny to handle diverse labeling and generation tasks in a consistent reasoning format. This is followed by reinforcement learning using downstream advertising metrics to align model behavior with online retrieval and ranking objectives. AdNanny is deployed in production within Bing Ads, where it significantly reduces manual labeling effort and improves accuracy across multiple offline tasks. By consolidating many task-specific models into a single reasoning-centric foundation model, AdNanny provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale advertising systems."}

Continuous Integration (CI) helps automate builds, tests, and releases, but its impact on mobile development remains underexplored. Despite the widespread use of CI, little is known about how it affects development activity, release speed, and user-facing outcomes in mobile projects. Existing studies mostly focus on CI adoption in general-purpose software, providing limited insight into mobile-specific dynamics, such as app store visibility and user engagement. In this paper, we analyze open-source Android apps to (1) compare CI adopters and non-adopters, (2) characterize adoption patterns using activity and bug metrics, and (3) assess pre/post adoption changes and user-facing outcomes. We observe that CI adopters are larger and more active, with faster and more regular releases. CI adoption is concentrated in integration- and reliability-intensive categories (e.g., finance and productivity) and is associated with higher Google Play Store engagement (more downloads and reviews) without lower ratings. Overall, CI adoption aligns with practices that support sustained delivery, higher project visibility, and stronger user engagement in mobile ecosystems."}

However, this success has introduced a growing scalability challenge, as artifact evaluation relies heavily on reviewers' manual execution and debugging, leading to escalating human effort amid rapidly increasing paper submissions. To address this problem, we investigate automated artifact evaluation. We first conduct a preliminary study on artifacts from top-tier SE conferences and identify three key challenges: perceiving execution states, maintaining stable execution environments, and recovering from execution errors. Inspired by these findings, we propose ArtifactCopilot, the first end-to-end agent-based framework for automated artifact evaluation. ArtifactCopilot automates environment construction, instruction execution, and error recovery by combining an execution normalization strategy to ensure environment stability with an artifact evaluation graph that transforms README documents into dependency-aware command graphs, enabling structured execution planning, execution-state tracking, and error recovery. Evaluation on 48 real-world artifacts shows that ArtifactCopilot matches human artifact evaluation outcomes for 85.42% of the artifacts, outperforming Claude Code by 52.09 percentage points, while costing only \\$0.091 per artifact on average and requiring zero human intervention for 45 out of 48 artifacts."}

To drive the research towards better coding agents, we require challenging benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate the ability of such agents to perform various software engineering tasks. However, popular coding benchmarks such as HumanEval and SWE-Bench focus on narrowly scoped tasks such as competition programming and patch generation. In reality, software engineers have to handle a broader set of tasks for real-world software development. To address this gap, we propose OmniCode, a novel software engineering benchmark that contains a broader and more diverse set of task categories beyond code or patch generation. Overall, OmniCode contains 1794 tasks spanning three programming languages (Python, Java, and C++) and four key categories: bug fixing, test generation, code review fixing, and style fixing. In contrast to prior software engineering benchmarks, the tasks in OmniCode are (1) manually validated to eliminate ill-defined problems, and (2) synthetically crafted or recently curated to avoid data leakage issues, presenting a new framework for synthetically generating diverse software tasks from limited real-world data. We evaluate OmniCode with popular agent frameworks such as SWE-Agent and show that while they may perform well on bug fixing for Python, they fall short on tasks such as Test Generation and in languages such as C++ and Java. For instance, SWE-Agent achieves a maximum of 20.9% with DeepSeek-V3.1 on Java Test Generation tasks. OmniCode aims to serve as a robust benchmark and spur the development of agents that can perform well across different aspects of software development.

However, their sophisticated capabilities also introduce severe safety concerns, particularly the generation of harmful content through jailbreak attacks. Current safety testing for LLMs often relies on static datasets and lacks systematic criteria to evaluate the quality and adequacy of these tests. While coverage criteria have been effective for smaller neural networks, they are not directly applicable to LLMs due to scalability issues and differing objectives. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RACA, a novel set of coverage criteria specifically designed for LLM safety testing. RACA leverages representation engineering to focus on safety-critical concepts within LLMs, thereby reducing dimensionality and filtering out irrelevant information. The framework operates in three stages: first, it identifies safety-critical representations using a small, expert-curated calibration set of jailbreak prompts. Second, it calculates conceptual activation scores for a given test suite based on these representations. Finally, it computes coverage results using six sub-criteria that assess both individual and compositional safety concepts. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate RACA's effectiveness, applicability, and generalization, where the results demonstrate that RACA successfully identifies high-quality jailbreak prompts and is superior to traditional neuron-level criteria. We also showcase its practical application in real-world scenarios, such as test set prioritization and attack prompt sampling. Furthermore, our findings confirm RACA's generalization to various scenarios and its robustness across various configurations. Overall, RACA provides a new framework for evaluating the safety of LLMs, contributing a valuable technique to the field of testing for AI."}

As such, they need to be tested thoroughly. Unfortunately, robot software is intrinsically hard to test compared to traditional software, mainly since the software needs to closely interact with hardware, account for uncertainty in its operational environment, handle disturbances, and act highly autonomously. However, given the large space in which robots operate, anticipating possible failures when designing tests is challenging. This paper presents a mapping study by considering robotics testing papers and relating them to the software testing theory. We consider 247 robotics testing papers and map them to software testing, discussing the state-of-the-art software testing in robotics with an illustrated example, and discuss current challenges. Forming the basis to introduce both the robotics and software engineering communities to software testing challenges. Finally, we identify open questions and lessons learned."}

Builds may fail intermittently due to non-deterministic factors, leading to flaky builds that undermine developers' trust in CI, waste computational resources, and threaten the validity of CI-related empirical studies. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of flaky builds in GitHub Actions based on rerun data from 1,960 open-source Java projects. Our results show that 3.2% of builds are rerun, and 67.73% of these rerun builds exhibit flaky behavior, affecting 1,055 (51.28%) of the projects. Through an in-depth failure analysis, we identify 15 distinct categories of flaky failures, among which flaky tests, network issues, and dependency resolution issues are the most prevalent. Building on these findings, we propose a machine learning-based approach for detecting flaky failures at the job level. Compared with a state-of-the-art baseline, our approach improves the F1-score by up to 20.3%."}

Our quantitative analysis finds that Codex consistently achieves high PR acceptance rates across most task categories, while Copilot's PRs trigger the highest volume of both human and automated review discussions.
