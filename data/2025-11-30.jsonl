Yet a core requirement remains unmet: ensuring that generated code is secure without compromising its functional correctness. Existing benchmarks and evaluations for secure code generation fall short-many measure only vulnerability reduction, disregard correctness preservation, or evaluate security and functionality on separate datasets, violating the fundamental need for simultaneous joint evaluation. We present DUALGAUGE, the first fully automated benchmarking framework designed to rigorously evaluate the security and correctness of LLM-generated code in unison. Given the lack of datasets enabling joint evaluation of secure code generation, we also present DUALGAUGE-BENCH, a curated benchmark suite of diverse coding tasks, each paired with manually validated test suites for both security and functionality, designed for full coverage of specification requirements. At the core of DUALGAUGE is an agentic program executor, which runs a program against given tests in sandboxed environments, and an LLM-based evaluator, which assesses both correctness and vulnerability behavior against expected outcomes. We rigorously evaluated and ensured the quality of DUALGAUGE-BENCH and the accuracy of DUALGAUGE, and applied DUALGAUGE to benchmarking ten leading LLMs on DUALGAUGE-BENCH across thousands of test scenarios. Our results reveal critical gaps in correct and secure code generation by these LLMs, for which our open-source system and datasets help accelerate progress via reproducible, scalable, and rigorous evaluation."}

However, their integration into product development remains fragmented. This fragmentation stems from uncertainty, particularly the lack of clarity on what types of DDMs to use and when to employ them across the product development lifecycle. To address this, a necessary first step is to investigate the usage of DDM in engineering design by identifying which methods are being used, at which development stages, and for what application. This paper presents a PRISMA systematic literature review. The V-model as a product development framework was adopted and simplified into four stages: system design, system implementation, system integration, and validation. A structured search across Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore (2014--2024) retrieved 1{,}689 records. After screening, 114 publications underwent full-text analysis. Findings show that machine learning (ML) and statistical methods dominate current practice, whereas deep learning (DL), though still less common, exhibits a clear upward trend in adoption. Additionally, supervised learning, clustering, regression analysis, and surrogate modeling are prevalent in design, implementation, and integration system stages but contributions to validation remain limited. Key challenges in existing applications include limited model interpretability, poor cross-stage traceability, and insufficient validation under real-world conditions. Additionally, it highlights key limitations and opportunities such as the need for interpretable hybrid models. This review is a first step toward design-stage guidelines; a follow-up synthesis should map computer science algorithms to engineering design problems and activities."}

As part of the study, the existing adaptive program management tools are analyzed, the use of infrastructure systems modelling tools is justified for program architecture and WBS creation. Existing models and modelling methods are viewed, and machine learning and artificial neural networks are selected for the model. The main components of the model are defined, which include a set of decision-maker preferences, decision-making tasks, sets of input data, and applied software components of the model. To support decision-making, the adaptive model applies the method of system modeling and predicting the value of the objective function at a given system configuration. Prediction is done using machine learning methods based on a dataset consisting of historical data related to existing engineering systems. The work describes the components of the redistribution of varied model parameters, which modify the model dataset based on the selected object type, which allows adapting the decision-making process to the existing program implementation goals. The functional composition done in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio is described. The neural network parameters and evaluation results are given. The application of the developed adaptive model is possible in the management of programs for the reconstruction of such engineering systems as systems of heat, gas, electricity supply, water supply, and drainage, etc."}

However, HoTT features an infinite hierarchy of equalities that may become unwieldy in formalisations. Fortunately, QITs and functional extensionality are both preserved even if the equality levels of Cubical Type Theory are truncated to only homotopical Sets (h-Sets). In other words, removing the univalence axiom from Cubical Type Theory and instead postulating a conflicting axiom: the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) postulate. Since univalence is proved in Cubical Type Theory from the so-called Glue Types, therefore, it is known that one can first remove the Glue Types (thus removing univalence) and then set-truncate all equalities (essentially assuming UIP), à la XTT. The result is a \"h-Set Cubical Type Theory\" that retains features such as functional extensionality and QITs.\n  However, in Cubical Agda, there are currently only two unsatisfying ways to achieve h-Set Cubical Type Theory. The first is to give up on the canonicity of the theory and simply postulate the UIP axiom, while the second way is to use a standard result stating \"type formers preserve h-levels\" to manually prove UIP for every defined type. The latter is, however, laborious work best suited for an automatic implementation by the proof assistant. In this project, we analyse formulations of UIP and detail their computation rules for Cubical Agda, and evaluate their suitability for implementation. We also implement a variant of Cubical Agda without Glue, which is already compatible with postulated UIP, in anticipation of a future implementation of UIP in Cubical Agda."}

We conduct an empirical study to systematically evaluate their understanding of cohesion (intra-module) and coupling (inter-module). We programmatically generate poorly designed code fragments and test the DeepSeek-R1 model family ($14$B, $32$B, $70$B) under varying levels of guidance, from simple \\textit{Verification} to \\textit{Guided} and \\textit{Open-ended Generation}, while varying contextual noise by injecting distractor elements. While models exhibit a solid baseline understanding of both concepts in ideal conditions, their practical knowledge is fragile and highly asymmetrical. Reasoning about coupling proves brittle; performance collapses in noisy, open-ended scenarios, with F1 scores dropping by over $50\\%$. In contrast, the models' analysis of cohesion is remarkably robust to internal noise in guided tasks, showing little performance degradation. However, this resilience also fails when all guidance is removed. Reasoning-trace analysis confirms these failure modes, revealing \\textit{cognitive shortcutting} for coupling versus a more exhaustive (yet still failing) analysis for cohesion. To summarize, while LLMs can provide reliable assistance for recognizing design flaws, their ability to reason autonomously in noisy, realistic contexts is limited, highlighting the critical need for more scalable and robust program understanding capabilities."}

Liu"], "title": "Lightweight Model Editing for LLMs to Correct Deprecated API Recommendations", "comment": null, "summary": "Pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in code completion tasks. However, their embedded knowledge is constrained by the timeliness of training data, which often includes code using deprecated APIs. Consequently, LLMs frequently generate deprecated APIs that will no longer be supported in future versions of third-party libraries. While retraining LLMs on updated codebases could refresh their API knowledge, this approach is computationally expensive. Recently, lightweight model editing methods have emerged to efficiently correct specific knowledge in LLMs. However, it remains unclear whether these methods can effectively update deprecated API knowledge and enable edited models to generate up-to-date APIs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study applying 10 state-of-the-art model editing techniques to update deprecated API knowledge in three LLMs: Qwen2.5-Coder, StarCoder2, and DeepSeek-Coder. We introduce EDAPIBench, a dedicated benchmark featuring over 70 deprecated APIs from 8 popular Python libraries, with more than 3,000 editing instances. Our results show that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method AdaLoRA achieves the best performance in enabling edited models to generate correct, up-to-date APIs, but falls short in Specificity (i.e., the editing influences untargeted knowledge). To resolve this, we propose AdaLoRA-L, which defines \"Common API Layers\" (layers within the LLMs with high importance across all APIs, storing general knowledge and excluded from editing) and restricts edits exclusively to \"Specific API Layers\" (layers with high importance only for the target API, storing the API-specific knowledge). Experimental results demonstrate that AdaLoRA-L significantly improves Specificity while maintaining comparable performance across other evaluation metrics."}

This paper presents a large-scale study of location-based Android app differentiation, uncovering two important and underexamined phenomena with security and fairness implications. First, we introduce GeoTwins: apps that are functionally similar and share branding but are released under different package names across countries. Despite their similarity, GeoTwins often diverge in requested permissions, third-party libraries, and privacy disclosures. Second, we examine the Android App Bundle ecosystem and reveal unexpected regional differences in supposedly consistent base.apk files. Contrary to common assumptions, even base.apk files vary by region, exposing hidden customizations that may affect app behavior or security.\n  These discrepancies have concrete consequences. Geographically distinct variants can lead the same app to be labeled benign in one malware study but suspicious in another, depending on the region of download. Such hidden variation undermines reproducibility and introduces geographic bias into assessments of security, privacy, and functionality. It also raises ethical concerns about transparency and consent: visually identical Google Play listings may mask subtle but important differences.\n  To study these issues, we built a distributed app collection pipeline spanning multiple regions and analyzed thousands of apps. We also release a dataset of 81,963 GeoTwins to support future work. Our findings reveal systemic regional disparities in mobile software, with implications for researchers, developers, platform architects, and policymakers."}

It emerged that developers conceive bug detection tools as \\textit{bug detectives}, which warn users only in case of critical issues, guaranteeing transparency, actionable feedback, and confidence cues. Readability assessment tools, on the other hand, are envisioned as \\textit{quality coaches}, which provide contextual, personalized, and progressive guidance.

Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems, such as GitHub Copilot's agent mode, promise to automate complex development workflows through coordinated reasoning, code generation, and tool interaction. This paper presents the first empirical study on how state-of-the-art multi-agent systems perform in dataset adaptation tasks. We evaluate Copilot, backed by GPT-4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4, on adapting SE research artifacts from benchmark repositories including ROCODE and LogHub2.0. Through a five-stage evaluation pipeline (file comprehension, code editing, command generation, validation, and final execution), we measure success rates, analyze failure patterns, and assess prompt-based interventions designed to enhance agent performance. Results show that current systems can identify key files and generate partial adaptations but rarely produce functionally correct implementations. Prompt-level interventions, especially providing execution error messages and reference code, substantially improve structural similarity to ground truth (from 7.25% to 67.14%), highlighting the importance of contextual and feedback-driven guidance. Our findings reveal both the promise and limitations of today's multi-agent LLM systems for dataset adaptation, and suggest concrete directions for building more reliable, self-correcting agents in future SE research."}

Although classic automated methods effectively explore program structures, they often lack the semantic information required to produce realistic inputs and assertions. Large Language Models (LLMs) address this limitation by utilizing by leveraging their data-driven knowledge of code semantics and programming patterns. To analyze the state of the art in this domain, we conducted a systematic literature review of 115 publications published between May 2021 and August 2025. We propose a unified taxonomy based on the unit test generation lifecycle that treats LLMs as stochastic generators requiring systematic engineering constraints. This framework analyzes the literature regarding core generative strategies and a set of enhancement techniques ranging from pre-generation context enrichment to post-generation quality assurance. Our analysis reveals that prompt engineering has emerged as the dominant utilization strategy and accounts for 89% of the studies due to its flexibility. We find that iterative validation and repair loops have become the standard mechanism to ensure robust usability and lead to significant improvements in compilation and execution pass rates. However, critical challenges remain regarding the weak fault detection capabilities of generated tests and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. We conclude with a roadmap for future research that emphasizes the progression towards autonomous testing agents and hybrid systems combining LLMs with traditional software engineering tools.
