Each handler\nhas a mailbox (modelled as a queue) for receiving messages, with the constraint\nthat the handler processes its messages sequentially. Executions of messages by\ndifferent handlers may be interleaved. A central problem in this setting is\nchecking whether a candidate execution is consistent with the semantics of\nevent-driven programs. In this paper, we propose an axiomatic semantics for\neventdriven programs based on the standard notion of traces (also known as\nexecution graphs). We prove the equivalence of axiomatic and operational\nsemantics. This allows us to rephrase the consistency problem axiomatically,\nresulting in the event-driven consistency problem: checking whether a given\ntrace is consistent. We analyze the computational complexity of this problem\nand show that it is NP-complete, even when the number of handler threads is\nbounded. We then identify a tractable fragment: in the absence of nested\nposting, where handlers do not post new messages while processing a message,\nconsistency checking can be performed in polynomial time. Finally, we implement\nour approach in a prototype tool and report on experimental results on a wide\nrange of benchmarks."}

RePatch extends the RefMerge framework, originally\ndesigned for symmetric merges, by supporting asymmetric patch transfer.

Early approaches in code\ntranslation rely on static rule-based methods, but they suffer from limited\ncoverage due to dependence on predefined rule patterns. Recent works regard the\ntask as a sequence-to-sequence problem by leveraging large language models\n(LLMs). Although these LLM-based methods are capable of reducing unsafe code\nblocks, the translated code often exhibits issues in following Rust rules and\nmaintaining semantic consistency. On one hand, existing methods adopt a direct\nprompting strategy to translate the C code, which struggles to accommodate the\nsyntactic rules between C and Rust. On the other hand, this strategy makes it\ndifficult for LLMs to accurately capture the semantics of complex code. To\naddress these challenges, we propose IRENE, an LLM-based framework that\nIntegrates RulEs aNd sEmantics to enhance translation. IRENE consists of three\nmodules: 1) a rule-augmented retrieval module that selects relevant translation\nexamples based on rules generated from a static analyzer developed by us,\nthereby improving the handling of Rust rules; 2) a structured summarization\nmodule that produces a structured summary for guiding LLMs to enhance the\nsemantic understanding of C code; 3) an error-driven translation module that\nleverages compiler diagnostics to iteratively refine translations.

Natural language (NL) prompts act as the\n``APIs'' for human-LLM interaction.

Building on this, we propose Controlled NL for Prompt (CNL-P),\nwhich not only incorporates PE best practices but also draws on key principles\nfrom software engineering (SE). CNL-P introduces precise grammar structures and\nstrict semantic norms, further eliminating NL's ambiguity, allowing for a\ndeclarative but structured and accurate expression of user intent. This helps\nLLMs better interpret and execute the prompts, leading to more consistent and\nhigher-quality outputs. We also introduce an NL2CNL-P conversion tool based on\nLLMs, enabling users to write prompts in NL, which are then transformed into\nCNL-P format, thus lowering the learning curve of CNL-P. In particular, we\ndevelop a linting tool that checks CNL-P prompts for syntactic and semantic\naccuracy, applying static analysis techniques to NL for the first time.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that CNL-P enhances the quality of LLM\nresponses through the novel and organic synergy of PE and SE.
