Recent work\nintroduced an LP compiler translating polynomial-time, polynomial-space\nalgorithms into polynomial-size LPs using intuitive high-level programming\nlanguages, offering a promising alternative to manually specifying each set of\nconstraints through Algebraic Modeling Languages (AMLs). However, the resulting\nLPs, while polynomial in size, are often extremely large, posing challenges for\nexisting LP solvers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating\nsubstantially smaller LPs from algorithms. Our goal is to establish\nminimum-size compact LP formulations for problems in P having natural\nformulations with exponential extension complexities. Our broader vision is to\nenable the systematic generation of Compact Integer Programming (CIP)\nformulations for problems with exponential-size IPs having polynomial-time\nseparation oracles. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical linear pipelining\ntechnique that decomposes nested program structures into synchronized regions\nwith well-defined execution transitions -- functions of compile-time\nparameters. This decomposition allows us to localize LP constraints and\nvariables within each region, significantly reducing LP size without the loss\nof generality, ensuring the resulting LP remains valid for all inputs of size\n$n$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two benchmark problems\n-- the makespan problem, which has exponential extension complexity, and the\nweighted minimum spanning tree problem -- both of which have exponential-size\nnatural LPs. Our results show up to a $25$-fold reduction in LP size and\nsubstantial improvements in solver performance across both commercial and\nnon-commercial LP solvers."}

Travassos"], "title": "Accelerating Discovery: Rapid Literature Screening with LLMs", "comment": "This version of the manuscript has been submitted to Empirical\n  Software Engieering Journal for consideration", "summary": "Background: Conducting Multi Vocal Literature Reviews (MVLRs) is often time\nand effort-intensive. Researchers must review and filter a large number of\nunstructured sources, which frequently contain sparse information and are\nunlikely to be included in the final study. Our experience conducting an MVLR\non Context-Aware Software Systems (CASS) Testing in the avionics domain\nexemplified this challenge, with over 8,000 highly heterogeneous documents\nrequiring review. Therefore, we developed a Large Language Model (LLM)\nassistant to support the search and filtering of documents. Aims: To develop\nand validate an LLM based tool that can support researchers in performing the\nsearch and filtering of documents for an MVLR without compromising the rigor of\nthe research protocol. Method: We applied sound engineering practices to\ndevelop an on-premises LLM-based tool incorporating Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) to process candidate sources. Progress towards the aim was\nquantified using the Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) as the primary metric to\nensure the performance of the LLM based tool. Convenience sampling, supported\nby human judgment and statistical sampling, were used to verify and validate\nthe tool's quality-in-use. Results: The tool currently demonstrates a PPA\nagreement with human researchers of 90% for sources that are not relevant to\nthe study. Development details are shared to support domain-specific adaptation\nof the tool. Conclusions: Using LLM-based tools to support academic researchers\nin rigorous MVLR is feasible. These tools can free valuable time for\nhigher-level, abstract tasks. However, researcher participation remains\nessential to ensure that the tool supports thorough research."}

According to the\nresults based on segmented regression analysis, the amounts of vulnerable\nproducts and components have not been stable; a linear trend describes many of\nthe series well. Nor do the amounts align well with trends characterizing\nvulnerabilities in general. There are also visible breakpoints indicating that\nthe linear trend is not universally applicable and that the growing security\ndebt may be stabilizing."}

To\naddress this challenge, automated approaches leveraging machine learning and\ncode embeddings have gained substantial attention. This study investigates the\noptimal combination of code embedding techniques and machine learning\nclassifiers for vulnerability detection in Python source code. We evaluate\nthree embedding techniques, i.e., Word2Vec, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT\nalongside two deep learning classifiers, i.e., Bidirectional Long Short-Term\nMemory (BiLSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). While CNN\npaired with GraphCodeBERT exhibits strong performance, the BiLSTM model using\nWord2Vec consistently achieves superior overall results. These findings suggest\nthat, despite the advanced architectures of recent models like CodeBERT and\nGraphCodeBERT, classical embeddings such as Word2Vec, when used with\nsequence-based models like BiLSTM, can offer a slight yet consistent\nperformance advantage. The study underscores the critical importance of\nselecting appropriate combinations of embeddings and classifiers to enhance the\neffectiveness of automated vulnerability detection systems, particularly for\nPython source code."}

A structured\nprotocol encompassing source selection, quality assessment, and thematic\nanalysis was applied to synthesize findings across heterogeneous sources.\n  Results: We finally identified 106 studies based on the selection criteria.\nThe analysis reveals that AI-native applications are distinguished by two core\npillars: the central role of AI as the system's intelligence paradigm and their\ninherently probabilistic, non-deterministic nature. Critical quality attributes\ninclude reliability, usability, performance efficiency, and AI-specific\nobservability. In addition, a typical technology stack has begun to emerge,\ncomprising LLM orchestration frameworks, vector databases, and AI-native\nobservability platforms. These systems emphasize response quality,\ncost-effectiveness, and outcome predictability, setting them apart from\nconventional software systems.\n  Conclusion: This study is the first to propose a dual-layered engineering\nblueprint..."}
