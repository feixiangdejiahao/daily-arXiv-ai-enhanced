Although large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict program outputs, most prior work has focused on output accuracy and performance, treating reasoning as a black box. As a result, little is known about the structure or failure modes of their reasoning traces. To address this gap, we conduct the first empirical study on runtime behavior inference with reasoning LLMs, aiming to uncover and characterize errors in their reasoning traces. We curate a benchmark from HumanEval Plus and LiveCodeBench, containing 427 code snippets. For each snippet, we test three input types: regular, edge, and invalid. Twelve input values are selected per snippet, each paired with its ground-truth execution result. We evaluate four state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs. Our results show that these models reach accuracies between 85 percent and 98 percent across input types. We also analyze the produced reasoning traces and develop a taxonomy with nine categories of inference errors. Finally, we explore tool-augmented reasoning. Using failures in the Computation Errors category as a case study, our experiments show that this approach corrects 58 percent of such errors, demonstrating the potential of tool support for improving LLM reasoning."}

Unlike traditional online learners, CodeFlowLM employs continual fine-tuning to address concept drift, class imbalance, and verification latency without retraining from scratch. We evaluated encoder-only and encoder-decoder PLMs (notably CodeT5+ and UniXCoder) in JIT-SDP scenarios within and between projects, comparing them with the incremental baseline BORB. The results show that CodeFlowLM achieves up to 68% G-Mean gains, confirming its superior adaptability and robustness in evolving software environments. We further extend the analysis to Just-in-Time Defect Localization (JIT-DL), benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro against attention-based models. GPT-5 delivers comparable performance for Recall@20% and Effort@20% with higher stability, although attention-based methods retain an advantage in fine-grained ranking metrics (Top-k, IFA). A qualitative error analysis reveals that most false positives arise from (1) human-like conservative bias, (2) insufficient contextual information in diff-based prompts, and (3) potential dataset mislabeling in JIT-Defects4J. These findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of LLM reasoning in defect localization. False negatives occur in smaller proportions. Overall, CodeFlowLM significantly advances the state of the art in incremental JIT-SDP, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness in evolving software environments. Furthermore, our exploratory analysis of LLMs in JIT-DL not only benchmarks their performance against established attention-based models but also provides critical insights into the current limitations of prompt-based defect reasoning."}

To address these issues, we developed ng-reactive-lint, a deterministic static analysis tool that understands Angular's component semantics, lifecycle hooks, template bindings, and reactivity patterns. Unlike generic ESLint or RxJS plugins, ng-reactive-lint performs framework-aware analysis to detect high-impact anti-patterns and provide actionable, context-specific fixes. Evaluation across five large real-world projects showed reductions of up to threefold in unnecessary change detection cycles and up to 75% lower peak memory usage.

Our approach incrementally incorporates long code snippets alongside textual content, overcoming standard LLM context window constraints and producing semantically rich summaries.

Although LLMs can usually maintain correct logical structures across programming languages, they frequently struggle when dealing with framework-specific APIs or syntax, resulting in errors. This indicates that while pre-training equips LLMs with general algorithmic capabilities, they remain unfamiliar with the distinctive syntax and API usage of underrepresented frameworks. As a result, even advanced commercial models like GPT-4o cannot reliably generate correct code without prior adaptation. To address this issue, we propose APIKG4SYN, a framework designed to exploit API knowledge graphs for the construction of API-oriented question-code pairs, specifically tailored for low-resource frameworks without requiring executable code. APIKG4SYN integrates both single-API and multi-API knowledge, where the latter is derived through uncertainty estimation (UE)-driven Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), enabling the creation of a diverse and informative dataset for fine-tuning LLMs. Using HarmonyOS as a case study, we build the first benchmark for HarmonyOS code generation. Experimental results show that fine-tuning Qwen with APIKG4SYN raises pass@1 accuracy to 25.00%, compared with 17.59% for the baseline GPT model. These results confirm that API-oriented data significantly enhance LLM performance in low-resource software development scenarios."}

Existing guardrails often fail when faced with indirect or contextually complex bias-inducing prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a unified framework for both systematic bias evaluation and targeted mitigation. Our approach introduces six novel Metamorphic Relations (MRs) that, based on metamorphic testing principles, transform direct bias-inducing inputs into semantically equivalent yet adversarially challenging variants. These transformations enable an automated method for exposing hidden model biases: when an LLM responds inconsistently or unfairly across MR-generated variants, the underlying bias becomes detectable. We further show that the same MRs can be used to generate diverse bias-inducing samples for fine-tuning, directly linking the testing process to mitigation. Using six state-of-the-art LLMs - spanning open-source and proprietary models - and a representative subset of 385 questions from the 8,978-item BiasAsker benchmark covering seven protected groups, our MRs reveal up to 14% more hidden biases compared to existing tools. Moreover, fine-tuning with both original and MR-mutated samples significantly enhances bias resiliency, increasing safe response rates from 54.7% to over 88.9% across models. These results highlight metamorphic relations as a practical mechanism for improving fairness in conversational AI."}

However, existing regression testing approaches face critical limitations, especially in common gray-box settings where full source code access is unavailable: they heavily rely on manual effort for test case construction, struggle to maintain growing suites plagued by redundancy, and lack efficient mechanisms for prioritizing relevant tests. These challenges result in excessive testing costs, limited automation, and insufficient bug detection. To address these issues, we propose SAGE, a semanticaware regression testing framework for gray-box game environments. SAGE systematically addresses the core challenges of test generation, maintenance, and selection. It employs LLM-guided reinforcement learning for efficient, goal-oriented exploration to automatically generate a diverse foundational test suite. Subsequently, it applies a semantic-based multi-objective optimization to refine this suite into a compact, high-value subset by balancing cost, coverage, and rarity. Finally, it leverages LLM-based semantic analysis of update logs to prioritize test cases most relevant to version changes, enabling efficient adaptation across iterations. We evaluate SAGE on two representative environments, Overcooked Plus and Minecraft, comparing against both automated baselines and human-recorded test cases. Across all environments, SAGE achieves superior bug detection with significantly lower execution cost, while demonstrating strong adaptability to version updates."}

This paper presents the first large-scale, empirical study of reproducibility practices in LLM-for-SE research. We systematically mined and analyzed 640 papers published between 2017 and 2025 across premier software engineering, machine learning, and natural language processing venues, extracting structured metadata from publications, repositories, and documentation. Guided by four research questions, we examine (i) the prevalence of reproducibility smells, (ii) how reproducibility has evolved over time, (iii) whether artifact evaluation badges reliably reflect reproducibility quality, and (iv) how publication venues influence transparency practices. Using a taxonomy of seven smell categories: Code and Execution, Data, Documentation, Environment and Tooling, Versioning, Model, and Access and Legal, we manually annotated all papers and associated artifacts. Our analysis reveals persistent gaps in artifact availability, environment specification, versioning rigor, and documentation clarity, despite modest improvements in recent years and increased adoption of artifact evaluation processes at top SE venues. Notably, we find that badges often signal artifact presence but do not consistently guarantee execution fidelity or long-term reproducibility. Motivated by these findings, we provide actionable recommendations to mitigate reproducibility smells and introduce a Reproducibility Maturity Model (RMM) to move beyond binary artifact certification toward multi-dimensional, progressive evaluation of reproducibility rigor."}

Despite their importance, scarce research systematically reports their value and provides constructive guidelines for programmers. To address this gap, our paper focuses on Qiskit, one of the most popular quantum SDKs, and presents CC4Q, the first dataset of code comments for quantum computing. CC4Q incorporates 9677 code comment pairs and 21970 sentence-level code comment units, the latter of which involve heavy human annotation. Regarding the annotation, we validate the applicability of the developer-intent taxonomy used in classical programs, and also propose a new taxonomy considering quantum-specific knowledge. We conduct an empirical study comprehensively interpreting code comments from three perspectives: comment structure and coverage, developers' intentions, and associated quantum topics. Our findings uncover key differences in code comments between classical and quantum software, and also outline quantum-specific knowledge relevant to quantum software development."}

However, they introduce operational complexities in service integration and system management that makes swift and accurate anomaly detection and localisation challenging. Despite the complex, dynamic, and interconnected nature of microservice architectures, prior works that investigate metrics for anomaly detection rarely include explicit information about time-varying interdependencies. And whilst prior works on fault localisation typically do incorporate information about dependencies between microservices, they scale poorly to real world large-scale deployments due to their reliance on computationally expensive causal inference. To address these challenges we propose FC-ADL, an end-to-end scalable approach for detecting and localising anomalous changes from microservice metrics based on the neuroscientific concept of functional connectivity. We show that by efficiently characterising time-varying changes in dependencies between microservice metrics we can both detect anomalies and provide root cause candidates without incurring the significant overheads of causal and multivariate approaches. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve top detection and localisation performance across a wide degree of different fault scenarios when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we illustrate the scalability of our approach by applying it to Alibaba's extremely large real-world microservice deployment."}

Method: Grounded in theories of infrastructure, attitudes, and prior work on psychometric measurement, we defined the target constructs and generated scale items. The scale was administered to 225 software professionals and evaluated using a split sample. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on one half of the sample to uncover the underlying factor structure and performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the other half to validate the structure. Further analyses with the whole sample assessed face, criterion-related, and discriminant validity. Results: EFA supported a two-factor structure (technical and sociotechnical infrastructure), accounting for 65% of the total variance with strong loadings. CFA confirmed excellent model fit. Face and content validity were supported by the item content reflecting cognitive, affective, and behavioral components. Both subscales were correlated with job satisfaction, perceived autonomy, and feedback from the job itself, supporting convergent validity. Regression analysis supported criterion-related validity, while the Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT), the Fornell-Larcker criterion, and model comparison all supported discriminant validity.

Results reveal widespread AI usage (95.2% of commits) but strategic attribution: only 29.5% employ explicit disclosure, with dramatic tool variation (Claude 80.5% versus Copilot 9.0%). Explicit attribution triggers modest scrutiny (23% more questions and 21% more comments) but tool choice matters 20-30 times more for predicting reception. Community sentiment remains neutral regardless of attribution type, suggesting curiosity rather than hostility. Temporal analyses show rapid norm evolution: explicit attribution increased from near-zero in early 2024 to 40% by late 2025, indicating community adaptation.

Objective: This study investigates how job satisfaction, work-life balance, job embeddedness, and their antecedents, including job quality, personality traits, attitudes toward technical and sociotechnical infrastructure, and perceptions of organizational justice, relate to software professionals' turnover intentions. Method: We conducted a geographically diverse cross-sectional survey of software professionals (N = 224) and analyzed the data using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Our model includes both reflective and formative constructs and tests 15 hypotheses grounded in occupational psychology and software engineering literature. Results: Job satisfaction and embeddedness were significantly negatively associated with software professionals' turnover intentions, while work-life balance showed no direct effect. The strongest antecedents for job satisfaction were work-life balance and job quality, while organizational justice was the strongest predictor of job embeddedness. Discussion: The resulting PLS-SEM model has considerably higher explanatory power for key outcome variables than previous work conducted in the software development context, highlighting the importance of both psychological (e.g., job satisfaction, job embeddedness) and organizational (e.g., organizational justice, job quality) factors in understanding turnover intentions of software professionals.

We automatically construct this task from the C++ portion of BigCode's The Stack by parsing functions with Tree-sitter, masking a single identifier, and treating the original name as supervision. On top of Llama 3.1-8B, we build a pipeline with (i) warmup and dropout schedules for more stable fine-tuning, (ii) LoRA adapters for efficient specialization on identifier repair, and (iii) a dual-encoder reranker over top-k generator candidates. We evaluate using exact match, Top-5 Hit, and an embedding-based partial similarity score (0-100) that gives credit for near synonyms and format variants (e.g., jsonValue vs. json). On a held-out set of 200 C++ functions, a zero-shot Llama 3.1 baseline reaches 6.1 percent exact match. Our best LoRA-tuned model (with warmup and dropout) achieves 43.1 percent exact match, 50.2 percent Top-5 Hit, and an 82.03 partial-match score. A dual encoder reranker further improves selection quality without modifying the underlying generator, suggesting that task-specific fine-tuning plus reranking is a promising approach for practical identifier repair tools."}

Prior research has largely focused on greenfield or synthetic tasks, leaving a gap in structured workflows for complex, context-heavy environments. This paper introduces the Discover-Define-Deliver (D3) Framework, a disciplined LLM-assisted workflow that combines role-separated prompting strategies with applied best practices for navigating ambiguity in brownfield systems. The framework incorporates a dual-agent prompting architecture in which a Builder model generates candidate outputs and a Reviewer model provides structured critique to improve reliability. I conducted an exploratory survey study with 52 software practitioners who applied the D3 workflow to real-world engineering tasks such as legacy system exploration, documentation reconstruction, and architectural refactoring. Respondents reported perceived improvements in task clarity, documentation quality, and cognitive load, along with self-estimated productivity gains. In this exploratory study, participants reported a weighted average productivity improvement of 26.9%, reduced cognitive load for approximately 77% of participants, and reduced rework for 83% during the Define phase. As these findings are self-reported and not derived from controlled experiments, they should be interpreted as preliminary evidence of practitioner sentiment rather than causal effects. The results highlight both the potential and limitations of structured LLM workflows for legacy engineering systems and motivate future controlled evaluations."}

We present LLM-as-a-Judge (LAJ), a production-ready, rubric-driven framework for evaluating Gherkin acceptance tests with structured JSON outputs. Across 20 model configurations (GPT-4, GPT-5 with varying reasoning effort, and open-weight models) on 100 expert-annotated scripts over 5 runs (500 evaluations), we provide the first comprehensive analysis spanning accuracy, operational reliability, and cost. We introduce the Evaluation Completion Rate (ECR@1) to quantify first-attempt success, revealing reliability from 85.4% to 100.0% with material cost implications via retries. Results show that smaller models can outperform larger ones: GPT-4o Mini attains the best accuracy (6.07 MAAE), high reliability (96.6% ECR@1), and low cost ($1.01 per 1K), yielding a 78x cost reduction vs. GPT-5 (high reasoning) while improving accuracy. Reasoning effort is model-family dependent: GPT-5 benefits from increased reasoning (with predictable accuracy-cost tradeoffs), whereas open-weight models degrade across all dimensions as reasoning increases.

Copyright 2025 IEEE. This is the author's accepted manuscript. The final published version may differ and will be available from IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Code review is critical for ensuring software quality and maintainability. With the rapid growth in software scale and complexity, code review has become a bottleneck in the development process because of its time-consuming and knowledge-intensive nature and the shortage of experienced developers willing to review code. Several approaches have been proposed for automatically generating code reviews based on retrieval, neural machine translation, pre-trained models, or large language models (LLMs). These approaches mainly leverage historical code changes and review comments. However, a large amount of crucial information for code review, such as the context of code changes and prior review knowledge, has been overlooked. This paper proposes an LLM-based review knowledge-augmented, context-aware framework for code review generation, named LAURA. The framework integrates review exemplar retrieval, context augmentation, and systematic guidance to enhance the performance of ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek v3 in generating code review comments. Besides, given the extensive low-quality reviews in existing datasets, we also constructed a high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that for both models, LAURA generates review comments that are either completely correct or at least helpful to developers in 42.2% and 40.4% of cases, respectively, significantly outperforming SOTA baselines. Furthermore, our ablation studies demonstrate that all components of LAURA contribute positively to improving comment quality."}

It is important for users to update their dependencies to safer versions, but many still use older, vulnerable package versions because upgrading can be difficult and may break their existing codebase. Software developers can mitigate this problem by backporting security patches to older releases. However, manually backporting is time-consuming and error-prone. The effectiveness of existing automated backporting techniques on general software remains unclear since they typically target only code-hunk or function-level patch porting scenarios and are evaluated with imperfect metrics.\n  To facilitate the development and evaluation of automated backporting techniques, we introduce BackportBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for patch backporting problem. BackportBench is a multilingual benchmark that contains 202 patch backporting problems from PyPI, Maven, and npm, each with executable Docker environments and relevant test cases. We evaluated existing patch porting methods and LLM-based techniques that have the potential to adapt to this task using BackportBench. The results show that the agentic method has outperformed traditional patch porting methods, especially on cases that require logical and structural changes. However, the performance varies across different programming languages. Based on the findings, we draw several implications for researchers and software practitioners in future work on automated backporting."}

This comfort can be leveraged to offer an online multi-institutional research-level course in an area where individual institutions may not have the requisite faculty to teach and/or research students to enroll. If the subject is of interest to industry, online offering also allows industry experts to contribute and participate with ease. Advanced topics in Software Engineering are ideally suited for experimenting with this approach as industry, which is often looking to incorporate advances in software engineering in their practices, is likely to agree to contribute and participate. In this paper we describe an experiment in teaching a course titled \"AI in Software Engineering\" jointly between two institutions with active industry participation, and share our and student's experience. We believe this collaborative teaching approach can be used for offering research level courses in any applied area of computer science by institutions who are small and find it difficult to offer research level courses on their own."}

ACM, New York, NY, USA, 12 pages", "summary": "Fuzzing is a highly effective method for uncovering software vulnerabilities, but analyzing the resulting data typically requires substantial manual effort. This is amplified by the fact that fuzzing campaigns often find a large number of crashing inputs, many of which share the same underlying bug. Crash deduplication is the task of finding such duplicate crashing inputs and thereby reducing the data that needs to be examined. Many existing deduplication approaches rely on comparing stack traces or other information that is collected when a program crashes. Although various metrics for measuring the similarity of such pieces of information have been proposed, many do not yield satisfactory deduplication results. In this work, we present GPTrace, a deduplication workflow that leverages a large language model to evaluate the similarity of various data sources associated with crashes by computing embedding vectors and supplying those as input to a clustering algorithm. We evaluate our approach on over 300 000 crashing inputs belonging to 50 ground truth labels from 14 different targets. The deduplication results produced by GPTrace show a noticeable improvement over hand-crafted stack trace comparison methods and even more complex state-of-the-art approaches that are less flexible."}

By employing lightweight MPI primitives, reductions in communication latency are achieved, facilitating more efficient data exchanges across distributed fuzzing nodes. Experimental results obtained over standard benchmarks demonstrate enhanced coverage progression from the early stages of the fuzzing process, which could be beneficial if fuzzing is employed in CI/CD pipelines at any stage of software development. Furthermore, the coordinated exchange of input corpora among clusters of fuzzers effectively addresses coverage stagnation, enabling a sustained exploration of complex and deep execution paths. Overall, the adoption of MPI-based synchronization approaches shows promising potential for significantly enhancing the scalability and efficacy of distributed fuzz testing."}

By combining dependency resolution with repository analysis, it reduces cognitive load and improves traceability. Demonstrating the framework's versatility, a large-scale study of 374,000 packages across five Linux distributions shows its ability to uncover not only conventional vulnerabilities and license conflicts but also overlooked risks such as archived or inaccessible repositories. Ultimately, Package Dashboard provides a unified view of risk, equipping developers and DevSecOps engineers with actionable insights to strengthen the transparency, trustworthiness, and traceability of open-source ecosystems.

However, automatically generated test cases are typically assigned non-descriptive names (e.g., test0, test1), which reduces their readability and hinders their usefulness during comprehension and maintenance. In this work, we present three novel deterministic techniques to generate REST API test names. We then compare eight techniques in total for generating descriptive names for REST API tests automatically produced by the fuzzer EvoMaster, using 10 test cases generated for 9 different open-source APIs. The eight techniques include rule-based heuristics and large language model (LLM)-based approaches. Their effectiveness was empirically evaluated through two surveys (involving up to 39 people recruited via LinkedIn). Our results show that a rule-based approach achieves the highest clarity ratings among deterministic methods, performs on par with state-of-the-art LLM-based models such as Gemini and GPT-4o, and significantly outperforms GPT-3.5.\n  To further evaluate the practical impact of our results, an industrial case study was carried out with practitioners who actively use EvoMaster at Volkswagen AG. A developer questionnaire was then carried out based on the use of EvoMaster on four different APIs by four different users, for a total of 74 evaluated test cases. Feedback from practitioners further confirms that descriptive names produced by this approach improve test suite readability.\n  These findings highlight that lightweight, deterministic techniques can serve as effective alternatives to computationally expensive and security-sensitive LLM-based approaches for automated system-level test naming, providing a practical step toward more developer-friendly API test generation."}

Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers."}
