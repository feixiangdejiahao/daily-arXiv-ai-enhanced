Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these advanced\ntechniques in the context of regression bugs remains largely unexplored. This\ngap motivates the need for an empirical study evaluating the effectiveness of\nmodern APR techniques in fixing real-world regression bugs.\n  In this work, we conduct an empirical study of APR techniques on Java\nregression bugs. To facilitate our study, we introduce RegMiner4APR, a\nhigh-quality benchmark of Java regression bugs integrated into a framework\ndesigned to facilitate APR research. The current benchmark includes 99\nregression bugs collected from 32 widely used real-world Java GitHub\nrepositories. We begin by conducting an in-depth analysis of the benchmark,\ndemonstrating its diversity and quality. Building on this foundation, we\nempirically evaluate the capabilities of APR to regression bugs by assessing\nboth traditional APR tools and advanced LLM-based APR approaches. Our\nexperimental results show that classical APR tools fail to repair any bugs,\nwhile LLM-based APR approaches exhibit promising potential. Motivated by these\nresults, we investigate impact of incorporating bug-inducing change information\ninto LLM-based APR approaches for fixing regression bugs. Our results highlight\nthat this context-aware enhancement significantly improves the performance of\nLLM-based APR, yielding 1.8x more successful repairs compared to using\nLLM-based APR without such context."}

Large language models (LLMs) offer new\nopportunities for APR, but existing studies mostly rely on smaller,\nearlier-generation models and Java benchmarks. The repair capabilities of\nmodern, large-scale LLMs across diverse languages and scenarios remain\nunderexplored. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of\nfour open-source LLMs, CodeLlama, LLaMA, StarCoder, and DeepSeek-Coder,\nspanning 7B to 33B parameters, diverse architectures, and purposes. We evaluate\nthem across two bug scenarios (enterprise-grades and algorithmic), three\nlanguages (Java, C/C++, Python), and four prompting strategies, analyzing over\n600K generated patches on six benchmarks. Key findings include: (1) model\nspecialization (e.g., CodeLlama) can outperform larger general-purpose models\n(e.g., LLaMA); (2) repair performance does not scale linearly with model size;\n(3) correct patches often appear early in generation; and (4) prompts\nsignificantly affect results. These insights offer practical guidance for\ndesigning effective and efficient LLM-based APR systems."}

This paper introduces ISONOISE,\na technique designed to identify such mislabelled test cases introduced during\nhuman-in-the-loop oracle learning. This technique can be applied to programs\ntaking numeric inputs. Given a compromised automatic test oracle and its\ntraining test suite, ISONOISE first isolates thetest cases suspected of being\nmislabelled. This task is performed based on the level of disagreement of a\ntest case with respect to the others. An intermediate automatic test oracle is\ntrained based on the slightly disagreeing test cases. Based on the predictions\nof this intermediate oracle, the test cases suspected of being mislabelled are\nsystematically presented for relabelling. When mislabelled test cases are\nfound, the intermediate test oracle is updated. This process repeats until no\nmislabelled test case is found in relabelling. ISONOISE was evaluated within\nthe human-in-the-loop oracle learning method used in LEARN2FIX. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that ISONOISE can identify mislabelled test cases\nintroduced by the human in LEARN2FIX with over 67% accuracy, while requiring\nonly a small number of relabelling queries. These findings highlight the\npotential of ISONOISE to enhance the reliability of human-in-the-loop oracle\nlearning."}

Existing literature abounds with recommendations on\nhow to write high-quality UC descriptions but lacks insights into (1) their\nreal-world adoption, (2) whether these recommendations correspond to actual\nquality, and (3) which factors influence the quality of UCs. Objectives: We aim\nto contribute empirical evidence about the adoption of UC descriptions in a\nlarge, globally distributed case company. Methods: We surveyed 1188 business\nrequirements of a case company that were elicited from 2020-01-01 until\n2024-12-31 and contained 1192 UCs in various forms. Among these, we manually\nevaluated the 273 template-style UC descriptions against established quality\nguidelines. We generated descriptive statistics of the format's adoption over\nthe surveyed time frame. Furthermore, we used inferential statistics to\ndetermine (a) how properties of the requirements engineering process affected\nthe UC quality and (b) how UC quality affects subsequent software development\nactivities. Results and Conclusions: Our descriptive results show how the\nadoption of UC descriptions in practice deviates from textbook recommendations.\nHowever, our inferential results suggest that only a few phenomena like\nsolution-orientation show an actual impact in practice. These results can steer\nUC quality research into a more relevant direction."}

To address this, FM providers\nintroduced tool calling-triggering a proliferation of frameworks with distinct\ntool interfaces. In late 2024, Anthropic introduced the Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) to standardize this tool ecosystem, which has become the de facto\nstandard with over eight million weekly SDK downloads. Despite its adoption,\nMCP's AI-driven, non-deterministic control flow introduces new risks to\nsustainability, security, and maintainability, warranting closer examination.\n  Towards this end, we present the first large-scale empirical study of MCP.\nUsing state-of-the-art health metrics and a hybrid analysis pipeline, combining\na general-purpose static analysis tool with an MCP-specific scanner, we\nevaluate 1,899 open-source MCP servers to assess their health, security, and\nmaintainability. Despite MCP servers demonstrating strong health metrics, we\nidentify eight distinct vulnerabilities-only three overlapping with traditional\nsoftware vulnerabilities. Additionally, 7.2% of servers contain general\nvulnerabilities and 5.5% exhibit MCP-specific tool poisoning.

However, these models also introduce\nchallenges in ensuring code quality. Existing approaches struggle to maintain\nboth visual consistency and functional completeness in the generated\ncomponents. Moreover, they lack mechanisms to assess the fidelity and\ncorrectness of the rendered pages. To address these issues, we propose\nDesignCoder, a novel hierarchical-aware and self-correcting automated code\ngeneration framework. Specifically, we introduce UI Grouping Chains, which\nenhance MLLMs' capability to understand and predict complex nested UI\nhierarchies. Subsequently, DesignCoder employs a hierarchical\ndivide-and-conquer approach to generate front-end code. Finally, we incorporate\na self-correction mechanism to improve the model's ability to identify and\nrectify errors in the generated code. Extensive evaluations on a dataset of UI\nmockups collected from both open-source communities and industry projects\ndemonstrate that DesignCoder outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in React\nNative, a widely adopted UI framework. Our method achieves a 37.63%, 9.52%,\n12.82% performance increase in visual similarity metrics (MSE, CLIP, SSIM) and\nsignificantly improves code structure similarity in terms of TreeBLEU,\nContainer Match, and Tree Edit Distance by 30.19%, 29.31%, 24.67%. Furthermore,\nwe conducted a user study with professional developers to assess the quality\nand practicality of the generated code. Results indicate that DesignCoder\naligns with industry best practices, demonstrating high usability, readability,\nand maintainability. Our approach provides an efficient and practical solution\nfor agile front-end development, enabling development teams to focus more on\ncore functionality and product innovation."}
