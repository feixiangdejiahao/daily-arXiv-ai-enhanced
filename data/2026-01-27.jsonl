We analyze 8,031 agentic pull requests (PRs) from 1,605 GitHub repositories where AI agents touch YAML configurations. CI/CD configuration files account for 3.25% of agent changes, varying by agent (Devin: 4.83%, Codex: 2.01%, p < 0.001). When agents modify CI/CD, 96.77% target GitHub Actions. Agentic PRs with CI/CD changes merge slightly less often than others (67.77% vs. 71.80%), except for Copilot, whose CI/CD changes merge 15.63 percentage points more often. Across 99,930 workflow runs, build success rates are comparable for CI/CD and non-CI/CD changes (75.59% vs. 74.87%), though three agents show significantly higher success when modifying CI/CD. These results show that AI agents rarely modify CI/CD and focus mostly on GitHub Actions, yet their configuration changes are as reliable as regular code. Copilot's strong CI/CD performance despite lower acceptance suggests emerging configuration specialization, with implications for agent training and DevOps automation."}

However, empirical evidence shows that many of these systems suffer from fundamental reliability issues, including hallucinated actions, unexecutable plans and brittle coordination. Crucially, these failures do not stem from limitations of the underlying models themselves, but from the absence of explicit architectural structure linking goals, capabilities and execution. This paper presents a declarative, model-independent architectural layer for grounded agentic workflows that addresses this gap. The proposed layer, referred to as DALIA (Declarative Agentic Layer for Intelligent Agents), formalises executable capabilities, exposes tasks through a declarative discovery protocol, maintains a federated directory of agents and their execution resources, and constructs deterministic task graphs grounded exclusively in declared operations. By enforcing a clear separation between discovery, planning and execution, the architecture constrains agent behaviour to a verifiable operational space, reducing reliance on speculative reasoning and free-form coordination. We present the architecture and design principles of the proposed layer and illustrate its operation through a representative task-oriented scenario, demonstrating how declarative grounding enables reproducible and verifiable agentic workflows across heterogeneous environments."}

An assignment is produced at most once via a writer and consumed at most once via its paired reader, and may contain additional readers and/or writers. This enables the concise expression of rich multidirectional communication modalities.\n  ``Logic Programs as Types for Logic Programs'' (LICS'91) defined types as regular sets of paths over derivable ground atoms. Here, we define types to be regular sets of moded paths, where a mode captures directionality of communication -- whether a subterm is consumed from or produced to the environment -- enabling the typing of interactive partial computations including those that eventually deadlock or fail, or never terminate. We provide a syntactic definition of well-typing and prove that a program is well-typed iff the path abstraction of its moded-atom semantics satisfies covariance and contravariance conditions with respect to its type.\n  The GLP type system was implemented in Dart by AI, starting from a mathematical specification of Typed GLP (this paper), deriving from it an English spec (written by AI), and from the spec deriving Dart code (by AI). While GLP is naturally untyped, the motivation for Typed GLP comes from programming with AI: Asking AI to program complex communication modalities in GLP (and in general) and hoping for the best is a tenuous strategy. The emerging discipline we advocate and employ is for the human designer and AI to jointly develop and agree upon (1)~GLP types; (2)~GLP procedure type declarations; (3)~informal (English) descriptions of the procedures; and only then let AI attempt to write (4)~GLP code based on those."}

In contrast, dynamic checks exist in practice (e.g. in MetaOCaml), but are understudied in theory. Designers of metalanguages are thus given little guidance regarding the design and implementation of checks. We present the first formal study of dynamic scope extrusion checks, introducing a calculus ($λ_{\\langle\\langle\\text{op}\\rangle\\rangle}$) for describing and evaluating checks. Further, we introduce a novel dynamic check $\\unicode{x2014}$ the \"Cause-for-Concern\" check $\\unicode{x2014}$ which we prove correct, characterise without reference to its implementation, and argue combines the advantages of existing dynamic checks.

While parsers prioritize semantic accuracy (i.e., event identification), they often obscure deep correlations between static templates and dynamic variables that are critical for storage efficiency. In this paper, we investigate this misalignment through a comprehensive empirical study and propose LogPrism, a framework that bridges the gap via unified redundancy encoding. Rather than relying on a rigid pre-parsing step, LogPrism dynamically integrates structural extraction with variable encoding by constructing a Unified Redundancy Tree (URT). This hierarchical approach effectively mines \"structure+variable\" co-occurrence patterns, capturing deep contextual redundancies while accelerating processing through pre-emptive pattern encoding. Extensive experiments on 16 benchmark datasets confirm that LogPrism establishes a new state-of-the-art. It achieves the highest compression ratio on 13 datasets, surpassing leading baselines by margins of 4.7% to 80.9%, while delivering superior throughput at 29.87 MB/s (1.68$\\times$~43.04$\\times$ faster than competitors).

The core innovation is a robust ground-plane homography estimation that links fixed traffic camera views to satellite orthoimagery. This process rectifies the camera's oblique perspective, ensuring that pixel distances accurately represent real-world distances. This enables the acquisition of features such as vehicle trajectory, speed, deceleration, and braking severity without the need for camera calibration. The pipeline employs the MAGSAC++ estimator to build the homography, converting YOLO11 object detections into a rectified top-down coordinate system. All detection and trajectory data are stored in a ClickHouse database for subsequent analysis. A real-world case study at two signalized intersections in Key West, Florida, showcased the system's capabilities. Across two days of daytime footage, braking activity at the higher-volume intersection peaked around 4 PM at approximately 57.5 events per hour, while the second intersection peaked around 10 AM at roughly 15.5 events per hour. The spatial analysis revealed that most braking events initiated upstream, with mild and moderate braking mostly occurring 30 to 45+ meters away from the stop bar and severe braking distributed throughout, but particularly concentrated in lanes with higher interaction and merging activity. The findings highlight the significant potential of this centralized safety information system to support connected vehicles, facilitating proactive traffic management, crash mitigation, and data-driven roadway design and safety analysis."}

This study presents an empirical analysis of developing a 7420 line Terminal User Interface framework for the Ring programming language, completed in roughly ten hours of active work spread across three days using a purely prompt driven workflow with Claude Code, Opus 4.5. The system was produced through 107 prompts: 21 feature requests, 72 bug fix prompts, 9 prompts sharing information from Ring documentation, 4 prompts providing architectural guidance, and 1 prompt dedicated to generating documentation. Development progressed across five phases, with the Window Manager phase requiring the most interaction, followed by complex UI systems and controls expansion. Bug related prompts covered redraw issues, event handling faults, runtime errors, and layout inconsistencies, while feature requests focused primarily on new widgets, window manager capabilities, and advanced UI components. Most prompts were short, reflecting a highly iterative workflow in which the human role was limited to specifying requirements, validating behaviour, and issuing corrective prompts without writing any code manually. The resulting framework includes a complete windowing subsystem, event driven architecture, interactive widgets, hierarchical menus, grid and tree components, tab controls, and a multi window desktop environment. By combining quantitative prompt analysis with qualitative assessment of model behaviour, this study provides empirical evidence that modern LLMs can sustain architectural coherence and support the construction of production grade tooling for emerging programming languages, highlighting prompt driven development as a viable methodology within software engineering practice."}

Yet roughly one-third of this feedback is never addressed due to limited time, expertise, or visibility, leaving many answers incomplete or outdated. This study investigates whether LLMs can enhance programming answers by interpreting and incorporating comment-based feedback. We make four main contributions. First, we introduce ReSOlve, a benchmark consisting of 790 SO answers with associated comment threads, annotated for improvement-related and general feedback. Second, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to identify actionable concerns, finding that DeepSeek achieves the best balance between precision and recall. Third, we present AUTOCOMBAT, an LLM-powered tool that improves programming answers by jointly leveraging user comments and question context. Compared to human revised references, AUTOCOMBAT produces near-human quality improvements while preserving the original intent and significantly outperforming the baseline. Finally, a user study with 58 practitioners shows strong practical value, with 84.5 percent indicating they would adopt or recommend the tool. Overall, AUTOCOMBAT demonstrates the potential of scalable, feedback-driven answer refinement to improve the reliability and trustworthiness of technical knowledge platforms."}

However, existing automated approaches remain insufficient. Traditional static analysis methods struggle to precisely capture contextual dependencies, especially when vulnerabilities span multiple functions or modules. Large language models (LLMs) often lack the ability to retrieve and exploit sufficient contextual information, resulting in incomplete reasoning and unreliable outcomes. Meanwhile, recurring vulnerabilities emerge repeatedly due to code reuse and shared logic, making historical vulnerability knowledge an indispensable foundation for effective vulnerability detection and repair. Nevertheless, prior approaches such as clone-based detection and patch porting, have not fully leveraged this knowledge. To address these challenges, we present MAVM, a multi-agent framework for end-to-end recurring vulnerability management. MAVM integrates five components, including a vulnerability knowledge base, detection, confirmation, repair, and validation, into a unified multi-agent pipeline. We construct a knowledge base from publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, thereby addressing the underuse of historical knowledge in prior work and mitigating the lack of domain-specific expertise in LLMs. Furthermore, we design context-retrieval tools that allow agents to extract and reason over repository-level information, overcoming the contextual limitations of previous methods. Based on agents, MAVM effectively simulates real-world security workflows. To evaluate the performance of MAVM, we construct a dataset containing 78 real-world patch-porting cases (covering 114 function-level migrations). On this dataset, MAVM successfully detects and repairs 51 real vulnerabilities, outperforming baselines by 31.9%-45.2% in repair accuracy, which demonstrates its effectiveness."}

In realistic project-level repair scenarios, software repositories often span millions of tokens, far exceeding current LLM context limits. Consequently, models must first identify a small, relevant subset of code, making accurate FL essential for effective repair. We present a novel project-level FL approach that improves both file- and element-level localization. Our method introduces a hierarchical reasoning module that (i) generates structured, bug-specific explanations for candidate files and elements, and (ii) leverages these explanations in a two-stage ranking scheme combining LLM-based and embedding-based signals. We further propose a counterfactual upper-bound analysis to quantify the contribution of each localization stage to repair success. We evaluate our approach on Python and Java projects from SWE-bench Verified, Lite, and Java. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including Agentless and OpenHands, our method consistently improves localization accuracy. On SWE-bench Verified, file-level Hit@1 improves from 71.4% to 85%, and MRR from 81.8% to 88.8%. At the element level, Exact Match under top-3 files increases from 36% to 69%. Integrating our localization into Agentless yields a 12.8% end-to-end repair success improvement."}

We introduce TAM-Eval (Test Automated Maintenance Evaluation), a framework and benchmark designed to evaluate model performance across three core test maintenance scenarios: creation, repair, and updating of test suites. Unlike prior work limited to function-level tasks, TAM-Eval operates at the test file level, while maintaining access to full repository context during isolated evaluation, better reflecting real-world maintenance workflows. Our benchmark comprises 1,539 automatically extracted and validated scenarios from Python, Java, and Go projects. TAM-Eval supports system-agnostic evaluation of both raw LLMs and agentic workflows, using a reference-free protocol based on test suite pass rate, code coverage, and mutation testing. Empirical results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs have limited capabilities in realistic test maintenance processes and yield only marginal improvements in test effectiveness. We release TAM-Eval as an open-source framework to support future research in automated software testing. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/trndcenter/TAM-Eval."}

Adoption of Coding Agents on GitHub", "comment": null, "summary": "In the first half of 2025, coding agents have emerged as a category of development tools that have very quickly transitioned to the practice. Unlike ''traditional'' code completion LLMs such as Copilot, agents like Cursor, Claude Code, or Codex operate with high degrees of autonomy, up to generating complete pull requests starting from a developer-provided task description. This new mode of operation is poised to change the landscape in an even larger way than code completion LLMs did, making the need to study their impact critical. Also, unlike traditional LLMs, coding agents tend to leave more explicit traces in software engineering artifacts, such as co-authoring commits or pull requests. We leverage these traces to present the first large-scale study (129,134 projects) of the adoption of coding agents on GitHub, finding an estimated adoption rate of 15.85%--22.60%, which is very high for a technology only a few months old--and increasing. We carry out an in-depth study of the adopters we identified, finding that adoption is broad: it spans the entire spectrum of project maturity; it includes established organizations; and it concerns diverse programming languages or project topics. At the commit level, we find that commits assisted by coding agents are larger than commits only authored by human developers, and have a large proportion of features and bug fixes. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the practical use of coding agents."}

However, this metric is inherently retrospective, reflecting only the past 90 days of activity and providing no insight into future maintenance, which limits its usefulness for proactive risk assessment. In this paper, we study to what extent future maintenance activity, as captured by the OpenSSF Maintained score, can be forecasted. We analyze 3,220 GitHub repositories associated with the top 1% most central PyPI libraries by PageRank and reconstruct historical Maintained scores over a three-year period. We formulate the task as multivariate time series forecasting and consider four target representations: raw scores, bucketed maintenance levels, numerical trend slopes, and categorical trend types. We compare a statistical model (VARMA), a machine learning model (Random Forest), and a deep learning model (LSTM) across training windows of 3-12 months and forecasting horizons of 1-6 months. Our results show that future maintenance activity can be predicted with meaningful accuracy, particularly for aggregated representations such as bucketed scores and trend types, achieving accuracies above 0.95 and 0.80, respectively. Simpler statistical and machine learning models perform on par with deep learning approaches, indicating that complex architectures are not required. These findings suggest that predictive modeling can effectively complement existing Scorecard metrics, enabling more proactive assessment of open-source maintenance risks."}

While post-training methods have become the de facto approach for code agents, **agentic mid-training**-mid-training (MT) on large-scale data that mirrors authentic agentic workflows-remains critically underexplored due to substantial resource requirements, despite offering a more scalable path to instilling foundational agentic behaviors than relying solely on expensive reinforcement learning. A central challenge in realizing effective agentic mid-training is the distribution mismatch between static training data and the dynamic, feedback-rich environment of real development. To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale. Central to our approach is **agent-native data**-supervision comprising two complementary types of trajectories: **contextually-native trajectories** that preserve the complete information flow an agent experiences, offering broad coverage and diversity; and **environmentally-native trajectories** collected from executable repositories where observations stem from actual tool invocations and test executions, providing depth and interaction authenticity. We verify the model's agentic capabilities on `SWE-Bench Verified`. We demonstrate our superiority over the previous open software engineering mid-training recipe `Kimi-Dev` under two post-training settings with an aligned base model and agentic scaffold, while using less than half mid-training tokens (73.1B). Besides relative advantage, our best performing 32B and 72B models achieve **56.1%** and **58.5%** resolution rates, respectively, which are ..."}

In this literature, computational experiments are the main means of evaluation, and the credibility of results depends on experimental design and reporting. Objective: This paper audits recent software defect prediction (SDP) studies by assessing their experimental design, analysis, and reporting practices against accepted norms from statistics, machine learning, and empirical software engineering. The aim is to characterise current practice and assess the reproducibility of published results. Method: We audited SDP studies indexed in SCOPUS between 2019 and 2023, focusing on design and analysis choices such as outcome measures, out of sample validation strategies, and the use of statistical inference. Nine study issues were evaluated. Reproducibility was assessed using the instrument proposed by González Barahona and Robles. Results: The search identified approximately 1,585 SDP experiments published during the period. From these, we randomly sampled 101 papers, including 61 journal and 40 conference publications, with almost 50 percent behind paywalls. We observed substantial variation in research practice. The number of datasets ranged from 1 to 365, learners or learner variants from 1 to 34, and performance measures from 1 to 9. About 45 percent of studies applied formal statistical inference. Across the sample, we identified 427 issues, with a median of four per paper, and only one paper without issues. Reproducibility ranged from near complete to severely limited. We also identified two cases of tortured phrases and possible paper mill activity. Conclusions: Experimental design and reporting practices vary widely, and almost half of the studies provide insufficient detail to support reproduction. The audit indicates substantial scope for improvement."}

An Empirical Characterization", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine Learning (ML) Operations (MLOps) frameworks have been conceived to support developers and AI engineers in managing the lifecycle of their ML models. While such frameworks provide a wide range of features, developers may leverage only a subset of them, while missing some highly desired features. This paper investigates the practical use and desired feature enhancements of eight popular open-source MLOps frameworks. Specifically, we analyze their usage by dependent projects on GitHub, examining how they invoke the frameworks' APIs and commands. Then, we qualitatively analyze feature requests and enhancements mined from the frameworks' issue trackers, relating these desired improvements to the previously identified usage features. Results indicate that MLOps frameworks are rarely used out-of-the-box and are infrequently integrated into GitHub Workflows, but rather, developers use their APIs to implement custom functionality in their projects. Used features concern core ML phases and whole infrastructure governance, sometimes leveraging multiple frameworks with complementary features. The mapping with feature requests highlights that users mainly ask for enhancements to core features of the frameworks, but also better API exposure and CI/CD integration."}
