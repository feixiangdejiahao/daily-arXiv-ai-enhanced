Thus developing unit tests targeting various design features requires deep understanding of the design functionality and creativity. When one or more unit tests expose a design failure, the debugging engineer needs to diagnose, localize, and debug the failure to ensure design correctness, which is often a painstaking and intense process. In this work, we introduce LAUDE, a unified unit-test generation and debugging framework for hardware designs that cross-pollinates the semantic understanding of the design source code with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of foundational Large-Language Models (LLMs). LAUDE integrates prompt engineering and design execution information to enhance its unit test generation accuracy and code debuggability. We apply LAUDE with closed- and open-source LLMs to a large corpus of buggy hardware design codes derived from the VerilogEval dataset, where generated unit tests detected bugs in up to 100% and 93% of combinational and sequential designs and debugged up to 93% and 84% of combinational and sequential designs, respectively."}

These tools have lowered the cost of code generation, explanation, and testing, while introducing new forms of automation into routine development tasks. In contrast, most of the software engineering and computer engineering curricula remain closely aligned with pedagogical models that equate manual syntax production with technical competence. This growing misalignment raises concerns regarding assessment validity, learning outcomes, and the development of foundational skills. Adopting a conceptual research approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how generative AI alters core software engineering competencies and introduces a pedagogical design model for LLM-integrated education. Attention is given to computer engineering programs in Turkey, where centralized regulation, large class sizes, and exam-oriented assessment practices amplify these challenges. The framework delineates how problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing increasingly shift from construction toward critique, validation, and human-AI stewardship. In addition, the paper argues that traditional plagiarism-centric integrity mechanisms are becoming insufficient, motivating a transition toward a process transparency model. While this work provides a structured proposal for curriculum adaptation, it remains a theoretical contribution; the paper concludes by outlining the need for longitudinal empirical studies to evaluate these interventions and their long-term impacts on learning."}

This fragmentation forces repetitive input, slows iterative exploration, and undermines reproducibility because parameter choices are difficult to record, share, and reuse. We present EZInput, a cross-runtime environment Python library enabling algorithm developers to automatically generate graphical user interfaces that make their computational tools accessible to end-users without programming expertise. EZInput employs a declarative specification system where developers define input requirements and validation constraints once; the library then handles environment detection, interface rendering, parameter validation, and session persistence across Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab, and terminal environments. This \"write once, run anywhere\" architecture enables researchers to prototype in notebooks and deploy identical parameter configurations for batch execution on remote systems without code changes or manual transcription. Parameter persistence, inspired by ImageJ/FIJI and adapted to Python workflows, saves and restores user configurations via lightweight YAML files, eliminating redundant input and producing shareable records that enhance reproducibility. EZInput supports diverse input types essential for scientific computing and it also includes built-in validation that ensures data integrity and clear feedback that reduces user friction."}

To address these issues, we present a formal translation framework based on relational Hoare logic, which enables robust and transparent transformations. Our method recognizes complex memory access patterns in naïve HLS programs and automatically transforms them by inserting on-chip buffers to enforce linear access to off-chip memory, and by replacing non-sequential processing with stream processing, while preserving program semantics.

Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising potential solution for automated parallel code generation, but naive prompting often results in syntactically incorrect directives, uncompilable code, or performance that fails to exceed CPU baselines. We present a systematic prompt optimization approach to enhance OpenACC pragma generation without the prohibitive computational costs associated with model post-training. Leveraging the GEPA (GEnetic-PAreto) framework, we iteratively evolve prompts through a reflective feedback loop. This process utilizes crossover and mutation of instructions, guided by expert-curated gold examples and structured feedback based on clause- and clause parameter-level mismatches between the gold and predicted pragma. In our evaluation on the PolyBench suite, we observe an increase in compilation success rates for programs annotated with OpenACC pragma generated using the optimized prompts compared to those annotated using the simpler initial prompt, particularly for the \"nano\"-scale models. Specifically, with optimized prompts, the compilation success rate for GPT-4.1 Nano surged from 66.7% to 93.3%, and for GPT-5 Nano improved from 86.7% to 100%, matching or surpassing the capabilities of their significantly larger, more expensive versions. Beyond compilation, the optimized prompts resulted in a 21% increase in the number of programs that achieve functional GPU speedups over CPU baselines. These results demonstrate that prompt optimization effectively unlocks the potential of smaller, cheaper LLMs in writing stable and effective GPU-offloading directives, establishing a cost-effective pathway to automated directive-based parallelization in HPC workflows."}

Domain-specific languages (DSL) typically use higher level intermediate representations (IR) in their compiler pipelines for domain-specific optimizations. As these IRs add to complexity, it is crucial to test them thoroughly. Random program generators have proven to be an effective tool to test compilers through differential and fuzz testing. However, developing specialized program generators for compiler IRs is not straightforward and demands considerable resources. We introduce MLIR-Forge, a novel random program generator framework that leverages the flexibility of MLIR, aiming to simplify the creation of specialized program generators. MLIR-Forge achieves this by splitting the generation process into fundamental building blocks that are language specific, and reusable program creation logic that constructs random programs from these building blocks. This hides complexity and furthermore, even the language specific components can be defined using a set of common tools. We demonstrate MLIR-Forge's capabilities by generating MLIR with built-in dialects, WebAssembly, and a data-centric program representation, DaCe -- requiring less than a week of development time in total for each of them. Using the generated programs we conduct differential testing and find 9 MLIR, 15 WebAssembly, and 774 DaCe groups of bugs with the corresponding program generators, after running them until the rate of new bugs stagnates."}

Decades of work has helped harden C code against attackers, but C projects do not consist of only C code. C projects also contain build system code for automating development tasks like compilation, testing, and packaging. These build systems are critcal to software supply chain security and vulnerable to being poisoned, with the XZ Utils and SolarWinds attacks being recent examples. Existing techniques try to harden software supply chains by verifying software dependencies, but such methods ignore the build system itself. Similarly, classic software security checkers only analyze and monitor program code, not build system code. Moreover, poisoned build systems can easily circumvent tools for detecting program code vulnerabilities by disabling such checks. We present development phase isolation, a novel strategy for hardening build systems against poisoning by modeling the information and behavior permissions of build automation as if it were program code. We have prototyped this approach as a tool called Foreman, which successfully detects and warns about the poisoned test files involved in the XZ Utils attack. We outline our future plans to protect against pipeline poisoning by automatically checking development phase isolation. We envision a future where build system security checkers are as prevalent as program code checkers."}

They produce inconsistent results when executed multiple times on the same code, invalidating the assumption that a test failure indicates a software defect. Recent work on LLM-based test generation has identified flakiness as a potential problem with generated tests. However, its prevalence and underlying causes are unclear. We examined the flakiness of LLM-generated tests in the context of four relational database management systems: SAP HANA, DuckDB, MySQL, and SQLite. We amplified test suites with two LLMs, GPT-4o and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, to assess the flakiness of the generated test cases. Our results suggest that generated tests have a slightly higher proportion of flaky tests compared to existing tests. Based on a manual inspection, we found that the most common root cause of flakiness was the reliance of a test on a certain order that is not guaranteed (\"unordered collection\"), which was present in 72 of 115 flaky tests (63%). Furthermore, both LLMs transferred the flakiness from the existing tests to the newly generated tests via the provided prompt context. Our experiments suggest that flakiness transfer is more prevalent in closed-source systems such as SAP HANA than in open-source systems. Our study informs developers on what types of flakiness to expect from LLM-generated tests. It also highlights the importance of providing LLMs with tailored context when employing LLMs for test generation."}

SafePlanner targets two core challenges: generating structurally meaningful test scenarios and detecting hazardous planning behaviors. To maximize coverage, SafePlanner performs a structural analysis of the Plan model implementation - specifically, its scene-transition logic and hierarchical control flow - and uses this insight to extract feasible scene transitions from code. It then composes test scenarios by combining these transitions with non-player vehicle (NPC) behaviors. Guided fuzzing is applied to explore the behavioral space of the Plan model under these scenarios. We evaluate SafePlanner on Baidu Apollo, a production-grade level 4 ADS. It generates 20635 test cases and detects 520 hazardous behaviors, grouped into 15 root causes through manual analysis. For four of these, we applied patches based on our analysis; the issues disappeared, and no apparent side effects were observed.

By treating agentic spans as first-class citizens within distributed traces, our methodology enables granular analysis of engineering characteristics beyond simple capabilities. Leveraging this benchmark across 21 system variants, we uncover critical engineering realities invisible to traditional metrics: a parameter paradox where lightweight models often surpass flagships in protocol adherence, a pervasive inference dominance that renders protocol overhead secondary, and an expensive failure pattern where self-healing mechanisms paradoxically act as cost multipliers on unviable workflows. This work provides the first systematic evidence to guide the transition from measuring model capability to engineering reliable AI-Native systems.

However, when these libraries introduce defects, ranging from silent computation errors to subtle performance regressions, it is often challenging for downstream users to assess whether their own programs are affected. Such impact analysis requires not only understanding the defect semantics but also checking whether the client code satisfies complex triggering conditions involving configuration flags, runtime environments, and indirect API usage. We present DepRadar, an agent coordination framework for fine grained defect and impact analysis in DL library updates. DepRadar coordinates four specialized agents across three steps: 1. the PR Miner and Code Diff Analyzer extract structured defect semantics from commits or pull requests, 2. the Orchestrator Agent synthesizes these signals into a unified defect pattern with trigger conditions, and 3. the Impact Analyzer checks downstream programs to determine whether the defect can be triggered. To improve accuracy and explainability, DepRadar integrates static analysis with DL-specific domain rules for defect reasoning and client side tracing. We evaluate DepRadar on 157 PRs and 70 commits across two representative DL libraries. It achieves 90% precision in defect identification and generates high quality structured fields (average field score 1.6). On 122 client programs, DepRadar identifies affected cases with 90% recall and 80% precision, substantially outperforming other baselines."}

This process is challenging because such bugs are non-deterministic, and bug reports often lack the detailed information needed. Additionally, the unstructured nature of reports written in natural language makes it difficult to extract necessary details. Existing tools are inadequate to reproduce these bugs due to their inability to manage the specific interleaving at the system call level. To address these challenges, we propose SysPro, a novel approach that automatically extracts relevant system call names from bug reports and identifies their locations in the source code. It generates input data by utilizing information retrieval, regular expression matching, and the category-partition method. This extracted input and interleaving data are then used to reproduce bugs through dynamic source code instrumentation. Our empirical study on real-world benchmarks demonstrates that SysPro is both effective and efficient at localizing and reproducing system-level concurrency bugs from bug reports."}

However, the standalone use of LLMs without post-processing has proven insufficient, often producing tests that fail to compile or achieve high coverage. Several techniques have been proposed to address these issues, reporting improvements in test compilation and coverage. While important, LLM-based test generation techniques have been evaluated against relatively weak baselines (for todays' standards), i.e., old LLM versions and relatively weak prompts, which may exacerbate the performance contribution of the approaches. In other words, stronger (newer) LLMs may obviate any advantage these techniques bring. We investigate this issue by replicating four state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tools, HITS, SymPrompt, TestSpark, and CoverUp that include engineering components aimed at guiding the test generation process through compilation and execution feedback, and evaluate their relative effectiveness and efficiency over a plain LLM test generation method. We integrate current LLM versions in all approaches and run an experiment on 393 classes and 3,657 methods. Our results show that the plain LLM approach can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches in all test effectiveness metrics we used: line coverage (by 17.72%), branch coverage (by 19.80%) and mutation score (by 20.92%), and it does so at a comparable cost (LLM queries). We also observe that the granularity at which the plain LLM is applied has a significant impact on the cost. We therefore propose targeting first the program classes, where test generation is more efficient, and then the uncovered methods to reduce the number of LLM requests. This strategy achieves comparable (slightly higher) effectiveness while requiring about 20% fewer LLM requests."}

While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation."}
