Despite growing efforts to support documentation through different kinds of artifacts, little is known about the motivations shaping documentation tool design or the factors hindering their adoption. We present a systematic review supported by mixed-methods analysis of 59 dataset documentation publications to examine the motivations behind building documentation tools, how authors conceptualize documentation practices, and how these tools connect to existing systems, regulations, and cultural norms. Our analysis shows four persistent patterns in dataset documentation conceptualization that potentially impede adoption and standardization: unclear operationalizations of documentation's value, decontextualized designs, unaddressed labor demands, and a tendency to treat integration as future work. Building on these findings, we propose a shift in Responsible AI tool design toward institutional rather than individual solutions, and outline actions the HCI community can take to enable sustainable documentation practices."}

We introduce ReLoop, addressing silent failures from two complementary directions. Structured generation decomposes code production into a four-stage reasoning chain (understand, formalize, synthesize, verify) that mirrors expert modeling practice, with explicit variable-type reasoning and self-verification to prevent formulation errors at their source. Behavioral verification detects errors that survive generation by testing whether the formulation responds correctly to solver-based parameter perturbation, without requiring ground truth -- an external semantic signal that bypasses the self-consistency problem inherent in LLM-based code review. The two mechanisms are complementary: structured generation dominates on complex compositional problems, while behavioral verification becomes the largest single contributor on problems with localized formulation defects. Together with execution recovery via IIS-enhanced diagnostics, ReLoop raises correctness from 22.6% to 31.1% and execution from 72.1% to 100.0% on the strongest model, with consistent gains across five models spanning three paradigms (foundation, SFT, RL) and three benchmarks. We additionally release RetailOpt-190, 190 compositional retail optimization scenarios targeting the multi-constraint interactions where LLMs most frequently fail."}

Concurrently, recent advances in LLMs have enabled strong performance on software engineering benchmarks, particularly when paired with agentic workflows. In this work, we systematically evaluate whether current LLMs can reliably perform long-context code debugging and patch generation. Using SWE-bench Verified as a controlled experimental setting, we first evaluate state-of-the-art models within an agentic harness (mini-SWE-agent), where performance improves substantially: GPT-5-nano achieves up to a 31\\% resolve rate on 100 samples, and open-source models such as Deepseek-R1-0528 obtain competitive results. However, token-level analysis shows that successful agentic trajectories typically remain under 20k tokens, and that longer accumulated contexts correlate with lower success rates, indicating that agentic success primarily arises from task decomposition into short-context steps rather than effective long-context reasoning. To directly test long-context capability, we construct a data pipeline where we artificially inflate the context length of the input by placing the relevant files into the context (ensuring perfect retrieval recall); we then study single-shot patch generation under genuinely long contexts (64k-128k tokens). Despite this setup, performance degrades sharply: Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B achieves only a 7\\% resolve rate at 64k context, while GPT-5-nano solves none of the tasks. Qualitative analysis reveals systematic failure modes, including hallucinated diffs, incorrect file targets, and malformed patch headers. Overall, our findings highlight a significant gap between nominal context length and usable context capacity in current LLMs, and suggest that existing agentic coding benchmarks do not meaningfully evaluate long-context reasoning."}

Most of these models rely on correlational split criteria, such as variance reduction or information gain, which identify statistical associations but cannot imply causation between X and Y. Recent empirical studies in software engineering show that both correlational models and causal discovery algorithms suffer from pronounced instability. This instability arises from two complementary issues: 1-Correlation-based methods conflate association with causation. 2-Causal discovery algorithms rely on heuristic approximations to cope with the NP-hard nature of structure learning, causing their inferred graphs to vary widely under minor input perturbations. Together, these issues undermine trust, reproducibility, and the reliability of explanations in real-world SE tasks. Objective: This study investigates whether incorporating causality-aware split criteria into symbolic models can improve their stability and robustness, and whether such gains come at the cost of predictive or optimization performance. We additionally examine how the stability of human expert judgments compares to that of automated models. Method: Using 120+ multi-objective optimization tasks from the MOOT repository of multi-objective optimization tasks, we evaluate stability through a preregistered bootstrap-ensemble protocol that measures variance with win-score assignments. We compare the stability of human causal assessments with correlation-based decision trees (EZR). We would also compare the causality-aware trees, which leverage conditional-entropy split criteria and confounder filtering. Stability and performance differences are analyzed using statistical methods (variance, Gini Impurity, KS test, Cliff's delta)"}

Roy"], "title": "Algorithm-Based Pipeline for Reliable and Intent-Preserving Code Translation with LLMs", "comment": "Accepted at 34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2026)", "summary": "Code translation, the automatic conversion of programs between languages, is a growing use case for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, direct one-shot translation often fails to preserve program intent, leading to errors in control flow, type handling, and I/O behavior. We propose an algorithm-based pipeline that introduces a language-neutral intermediate specification to capture these details before code generation. This study empirically evaluates the extent to which structured planning can improve translation accuracy and reliability relative to direct translation. We conduct an automated paired experiment - direct and algorithm-based to translate between Python and Java using five widely used LLMs on the Avatar and CodeNet datasets. For each combination (model, dataset, approach, and direction), we compile and execute the translated program and run the tests provided. We record compilation results, runtime behavior, timeouts (e.g., infinite loop), and test outcomes. We compute accuracy from these tests, counting a translation as correct only if it compiles, runs without exceptions or timeouts, and passes all tests. We then map every failed compile-time and runtime case to a unified, language-aware taxonomy and compare subtype frequencies between the direct and algorithm-based approaches. Overall, the Algorithm-based approach increases micro-average accuracy from 67.7% to 78.5% (10.8% increase). It eliminates lexical and token errors by 100%, reduces incomplete constructs by 72.7%, and structural and declaration issues by 61.1%. It also substantially lowers runtime dependency and entry-point failures by 78.4%. These results demonstrate that algorithm-based pipelines enable more reliable, intent-preserving code translation, providing a foundation for robust multilingual programming assistants."}

Existing work uses external equality saturation libraries, or custom implementations that are deeply tied to the specific application. However, these works only apply equality saturation at a single level of abstraction, or discard the discovered equalities when code is transformed by other compiler passes. We propose an alternative approach that represents an e-graph natively in the compiler's intermediate representation, facilitating the application of constructive compiler passes that maintain the e-graph state throughout the compilation flow. We build on a Python-based MLIR framework, xDSL, and introduce a new MLIR dialect, eqsat, that represents e-graphs in MLIR code. We show that this representation expands the scope of equality saturation in the compiler, allowing us to interleave pattern rewriting with other compiler transformations. The eqsat dialect provides a unified abstraction for compilers to utilize equality saturation across various levels of intermediate representations concurrently within the same MLIR flow."}

Software is becoming increasingly important, not only in general but specifically in relation to manufacturing, especially with regard to digital manufacturing and a shift towards the usage of artificial intelligence. This increases the need not only to model software, but also to integrate services directly into the AAS. The existing literature contains individual solutions to implement such software-heavy AAS. However, there is no systematic analysis of software architectures that integrate software services directly into the AAS. This paper aims to fill this research gap and differentiate architectures based on software quality criteria as well as typical manufacturing use cases. This work may be considered as an interpretation guideline for software-heavy AAS, both in academia and for practitioners."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities, direct intent-to-code synthesis frequently suffers from the leap-to-code failure mode, where models prematurely emit code without grounding in program structure, constraints, and semantics. This will result in non-compilable tests, hallucinated function signatures, low branch coverage, and semantically irrelevant assertions that cannot properly capture bugs. We introduce SPARC, a neuro-symbolic, scenario-based framework that bridges this gap through four stages: (1) Control Flow Graph (CFG) analysis, (2) an Operation Map that grounds LLM reasoning in validated utility helpers, (3) Path-targeted test synthesis, and (4) an iterative, self-correction validation loop using compiler and runtime feedback. We evaluate SPARC on 59 real-world and algorithmic subjects, where it outperforms the vanilla prompt generation baseline by 31.36% in line coverage, 26.01% in branch coverage, and 20.78% in mutation score, matching or exceeding the symbolic execution tool KLEE on complex subjects. SPARC retains 94.3% of tests through iterative repair and produces code with significantly higher developer-rated readability and maintainability. By aligning LLM reasoning with program structure, SPARC provides a scalable path for industrial-grade testing of legacy C codebases."}
