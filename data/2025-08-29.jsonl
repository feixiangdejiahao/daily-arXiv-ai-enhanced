We introduce the notion of solvable tuple patterns (STPs)\nto express invariants between list-like recursive data structures. A\ndistinguishing feature of STPs is that they can be efficiently inferred from\nonly a small number of positive samples; no negative samples are required. An\nSMT solver that supports the sequence theory can be used to check that an\ninferred STP is indeed an inductive invariant. After presenting basic\nproperties of STPs and an STP inference algorithm, we show how to incorporate\nthe STP inference into a CHC (Constrained Horn Clauses) solver supporting\nlist-like data structures, which serves as a uniform backend for automated\nprogram verification tools. A CHC solver incorporating the STP inference has\nwon the ADT-LIN category of CHC-COMP 2025 by a big margin."}

In this work,\nwe address the open question to what extent a probabilistic program with\nuser-labelled sample statements and while loops - features found in languages\nlike Gen, Turing, and Pyro - can be represented graphically. To this end, we\nextend existing operational semantics to support these language features. By\ntranslating a program to its control-flow graph, we define a sound static\nanalysis that approximates the dependency structure of the random variables in\nthe program. As a result, we obtain a static factorisation of the implicitly\ndefined program density, which is equivalent to the known Bayesian network\nfactorisation for programs without loops and constant labels, but constitutes a\nnovel graphical representation for programs that define an unbounded number of\nrandom variables via loops or dynamic labels. We further develop a sound\nprogram slicing technique to leverage this structure to statically enable three\nwell-known optimisations for the considered program class: we reduce the\nvariance of gradient estimates in variational inference and we speed up both\nsingle-site Metropolis Hastings and sequential Monte Carlo. These optimisations\nare proven correct and empirically shown to match or outperform existing\ntechniques."}

Ensuring\nsystem reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces\nand metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing\nmethods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to\nevolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning\nprocess, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this\npaper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of\nfailures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different\norganizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis\nexhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion,\nand cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent,\nan adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that\nleverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a\nnovel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process,\neffectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to\naccurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public\ndatasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing\nthe root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore\nthe effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root\ncause localization in complex microservice environments."}

In addition, CPS simulators may be\nflaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test\nre-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not\nrequire system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs.\nIdeally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human\nunderstanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential\nflakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test\noracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the\ninputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test\noracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes,\nfails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe\ntwo methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic\nprogramming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization\n(SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness\nfunctions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We\nevaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains\nof aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles\ngenerated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those\nobtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this\naccuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system\nunder test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by\nGP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in\ntheir accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving\nsystems with flaky behaviours."}

Second, they lack\nsufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary\nclassification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as\nprecise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for\neffective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a\ndedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation.\nWe then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network\n(GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that\nconcisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics.
