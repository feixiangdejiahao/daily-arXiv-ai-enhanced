However, existing fuzzing tools and\ninput generators are typically handcrafted for specific input types and often\ngenerate invalid inputs that are subsequently discarded, leading to\ninefficiency and poor generalizability. [Objective] This study investigates\nwhether test inputs for structured domains can be unified through a graph-based\nrepresentation, enabling general, reusable mutation strategies while enforcing\nstructural constraints. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in\nenhancing input validity and semantic preservation across eight AI systems.\n[Method] We develop and evaluate GRAphRef, a graph-based test input generation\nframework that supports constraint-based mutation and refinement. GRAphRef maps\nstructured inputs to graphs, applies neighbor-similarity-guided mutations, and\nuses a constraint-refinement phase to repair invalid inputs. We will conduct a\nconfirmatory study across eight real-world mesh-processing AI systems,\ncomparing GRAphRef with AFL, MeshAttack, Saffron, and two ablated variants.\nEvaluation metrics include structural validity, semantic preservation (via\nprediction consistency), and performance overhead.

Once references\nare added, this impredicative quantification can be exploited to encode\nrecursion.

Existing programming paradigms lack\ndirect support for these inherently fixed-point computations, leading to\ninefficient and error-prone implementations.\n  This white paper explores the potential of the FPOP paradigm, which offers a\nhigh-level abstraction that enables concise and expressive problem\nformulations. By leveraging structured inference rules and user-directed\noptimizations, FPOP allows developers to write declarative specifications while\nthe compiler ensures efficient execution. It not only reduces implementation\ncomplexity for programmers but also enhances adaptability, making it easier for\nprogrammers to explore alternative solutions and optimizations without\nmodifying the core logic of their program.\n  We demonstrate how FPOP simplifies algorithm implementation, improves\nmaintainability, and enables rapid prototyping by allowing problems to be\nclearly and concisely expressed.
