The focus is on quantum\nand hybrid quantum-classical software systems, where model-driven approaches\ncan help reduce the costs and mitigate the risks associated with the\nheterogeneous platform landscape and lack of developers' skills. We validate\none of the proposed ideas regarding generating code out of UML model instances\nof software systems. This Python code uses a well-established library, called\nQiskit, to execute on gate-based or circuit-based quantum computers. The RAG\npipeline that we deploy incorporates sample Qiskit code from public GitHub\nrepositories. Experimental results show that well-engineered prompts can\nimprove CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and\nconsistent quantum code. However, the proposed research direction can go beyond\nthis through further investigation in the future by conducting experiments to\naddress our other research questions and ideas proposed here, such as deploying\nsoftware system model instances as the source of information in the RAG\npipelines, or deploying LLMs for code-to-code transformations, for instance,\nfor transpilation use cases."}

Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have\nbeen employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to\nproduce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL,\na novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate\nhigh-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to\niteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in\nan adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is\ntrained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to\nproduce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the\ncode generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability\nto produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator.\nIn our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B\ntrained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the\nsame model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth\nunit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those\ninduced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL\noutperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit\ntests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task."}

We present\na systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench\nVerified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple\nobservation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while\nmatching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM\nsummarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate\nfrom 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization\nat a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on\nSWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be\nthe simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility"}

CrossTL uses a single universal IR to facilitate translations between\nCUDA, HIP, Metal, DirectX HLSL, OpenGL GLSL, Vulkan SPIR-V, Rust, and Mojo,\nwith Slang support in development. Our system consists of: language-specific\nlexers/parsers converting source code to ASTs, bidirectional CrossGL\ntranslation modules implementing ToCrossGLConverter classes for importing code\nand CodeGen classes for target generation, and comprehensive backend\nimplementations handling full translation pipelines. We demonstrate\neffectiveness through comprehensive evaluation across programming domains,\nachieving successful compilation and execution across all supported backends.\nThe universal IR design enables adding new languages with minimal effort,\nrequiring only language-specific frontend/backend components. Our contributions\ninclude: (1) a unified IR capturing semantics of multiple programming\nparadigms, (2) a modular architecture enabling extensibility, (3) a\ncomprehensive framework supporting GPU compute, graphics programming, and\nsystems languages, and (4) empirical validation demonstrating practical\nviability of universal code translation.

However, existing\nframeworks continue to suffer from the propagation of incorrect facts. A major\nlimitation stems from their insufficient semantic understanding of code,\nresulting in overly conservative treatment of user-defined functions. Recent\nadvances in large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities to bridge\nthis gap. In this paper, we propose LMPA (LLM-enhanced Pointer Analysis), a\nvision that integrates LLMs into pointer analysis to enhance both precision and\nscalability. LMPA identifies user-defined functions that resemble system APIs\nand models them accordingly, thereby mitigating erroneous cross-calling-context\npropagation. Furthermore, it enhances summary-based analysis by inferring\ninitial points-to sets and introducing a novel summary strategy augmented with\nnatural language. Finally, we discuss the key challenges involved in realizing\nthis vision."}

However, validating the reliability and performance of\nthe agent policies' behavior for deployment remains challenging. Most\nreinforcement learning policy testing methods produce test suites tailored to\nthe agent policy being tested, and their relevance to other policies is\nunclear. This work presents Multi-Policy Test Case Selection (MPTCS), a novel\nautomated test suite selection method for RL environments, designed to extract\ntest cases generated by any policy testing framework based on their\nsolvability, diversity, and general difficulty. MPTCS uses a set of policies to\nselect a diverse collection of reusable policy-agnostic test cases that reveal\ntypical flaws in the agents' behavior. The set of policies selects test cases\nfrom a candidate pool, which can be generated by any policy testing method,\nbased on a difficulty score. We assess the effectiveness of the difficulty\nscore and how the method's effectiveness and cost depend on the number of\npolicies in the set. Additionally, a method for promoting diversity in the test\nsuite, a discretized general test case descriptor surface inspired by\nquality-diversity algorithms, is examined to determine how it covers the state\nspace and which policies it triggers to produce faulty behaviors."}

Our evaluation spans over 500k code\nsamples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via\nOrthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common\nWeakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and\nmore repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging,\nwhile human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher\nconcentration of maintainability issues.
