To build such a\ncontext-sensitive parser, we propose a framework of a dynamic tree of parsers\n(ToP) during parsing, where each parser corresponds to a modular context-free\ngrammar enriched with contextual information such as variable scopes and type\nconstraints, with tree branches representing ambiguity in the future code\nsegment. We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of\nLua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs\nconforming to any prescribed scripting API.

Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the\npractical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex\ncalculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such\nas perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence\nor uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and\ncan serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in\nLLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when\ngenerating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages,\nmodels, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657\nGitHub projects.

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in\ndetecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant\nvulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic,\nempirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of\nfoundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced,\nproduction-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from\nSEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated\nthrough local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage,\ncontext-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while\na graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation\nquality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and\nsemantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use\nand as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes\nin scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale\nproduction code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced\ncontextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the\npresent constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools."}

However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has\nextensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been\ngiven to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution\nof ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses\nthis gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking\nframework for managing software engineering practices, with large language\nmodels (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist\nstudents and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot\nemploys a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant\ncontextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were\nused to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base\nmodel and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated\nthrough both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated\nresponses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated\nthat the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in\ndomain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software\nengineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between\ntheoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process\nmanagement and the adoption of software development practices. While further\nvalidation through user studies is required, these findings highlight the\npotential of LLM-based automation to enhance learning and decision-making in\nsoftware engineering."}

However, LLMs are constrained by\nhigh computational resource requirements. Aims: We focus on small language\nmodels (SLMs), which perform well even with limited computational resources\ncompared to LLMs. We aim to evaluate whether SLMs can achieve competitive\nperformance in APR tasks. Method: We conducted experiments on the QuixBugs\nbenchmark to compare the bug-fixing accuracy of SLMs and LLMs. We also analyzed\nthe impact of int8 quantization on APR performance. Results: The latest SLMs\ncan fix bugs as accurately as--or even more accurately than--LLMs. Also, int8\nquantization had minimal effect on APR accuracy while significantly reducing\nmemory requirements. Conclusions: SLMs present a viable alternative to LLMs for\nAPR, offering competitive accuracy with lower computational costs, and\nquantization can further enhance their efficiency without compromising\neffectiveness."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great\npotential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging\nmethods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is\nbug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are\noverwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To\naddress this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates\ndilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module\ninto semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits\nare merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework\ngenerates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and\nscales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92%\npass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including\nClaude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also,\nsemantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over\nwhole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope\nreduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging."}

Although peephole optimization is a\ncritical class of compiler optimizations, discovering new and effective\npeephole optimizations is challenging as the instruction sets can be extremely\ncomplex and diverse. Previous methods either do not scale well or can only\ncapture a limited subset of peephole optimizations. In this work, we leverage\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to detect missed peephole optimizations. We\npropose Lampo, a novel automated framework that synergistically combines the\ncreative but unreliable code optimization ability of LLMs with rigorous\ncorrectness verification performed by translation validation tools, integrated\nin a feedback-driven iterative process. Through a comprehensive evaluation\nwithin LLVM ecosystems, we show that Lampo can successfully detect up to 17 out\nof 25 previously reported missed optimizations in LLVM on average, and that 22\nout of 25 can potentially be found by Lampo with different LLMs. For\ncomparison, the state-of-the-art superoptimizer for LLVM, Souper, identified 15\nof them. Moreover, within seven months of development and intermittent\nexperiments, Lampo found 26 missed peephole optimizations, 15 of which have\nbeen confirmed and 6 already fixed. These results demonstrate Lampo's strong\npotential in continuously detecting missed peephole optimizations."}
