In this work, we investigate the effect of merging the\nhidden representations of subtokens that belong to the same semantic unit, such\nas subtokens that form a single identifier. We propose two strategies: one\nbased on averaging the representations and another that leverages a\nlearning-based approach. Both methods can be seamlessly integrated with\nexisting language models for code. We conduct experiments using six language\nmodels for code: CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UniXCoder, CdoeT5, CodeT5+ (220M),\nand CodeT5+ (770M), across three software engineering tasks: vulnerability\ndetection, code classification, and code translation.

Objectives: We hypothesize that developers'\ninteractions with CGTs vary based on gender, influencing task outcomes and\ncognitive load, as prior research suggests that gender differences can affect\ntechnology use and cognitive processing. Methods: The study will employ a\nmixed-subjects design with 54 participants, evenly divided by gender for a\ncounterbalanced design. Participants will complete two programming tasks\n(medium to hard difficulty) with only CGT assistance and then with only\ninternet access. Task orders and conditions will be counterbalanced to mitigate\norder effects.

One such intrinsic limitation is its inability to\neffectively capture the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular expressions or\ndeterministic context-free grammars. Drawing inspiration from pushdown\nautomata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using\nstacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs.\nUnlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans\nexplicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers. This\ndesign maintains compatibility with existing frameworks like flash-attention.\nSpecifically, our design features stack operations -- such as pushing and\npopping hidden states -- that are differentiable and can be learned in an\nend-to-end manner. Our comprehensive evaluation spans benchmarks for both\nChomsky hierarchies and large-scale natural languages. Across these diverse\ntasks, StackTrans consistently outperforms standard Transformer models and\nother baselines. We have successfully scaled StackTrans up from 360M to 7B\nparameters. In particular, our from-scratch pretrained model StackTrans-360M\noutperforms several larger open-source LLMs with 2-3x more parameters,\nshowcasing its superior efficiency and reasoning capability."}

Despite their utility, the training datasets for top\nLLM remain undisclosed, raising concerns about potential copyright violations.\nSome models, such as Pleias and Comma put emphasis on data curation and\nlicenses, however, with limited training data these models are not competitive\nand only serve as proof of concepts. To improve the utility of these models, we\npropose an application of the \"Chinese Wall\" technique, inspired by the reverse\nengineering technique of the same name -- a high quality model is used to\ngenerate detailed instructions for a weaker model. By doing so, a weaker but\nethically aligned model may be used to perform complicated tasks that,\notherwise, can only be completed by more powerful models. In our evaluation,\nwe've found that this technique improves Comma v0.1 1T's performance in\nCanItEdit benchmark by over 66%, and Starcoder2 Instruct by roughly 20%\ncompared to when running the same model on the benchmark alone. The practical\napplication of this technique today, however, may be limited due to the lack of\nmodels trained on public domain content without copyright restrictions."}

The study utilizes an exploratory data analysis to investigate the\nmost frequently discussed keywords, error classification, and user\nreputation-based errors, which is the novelty of this work. The results show\nthe top eight most frequently used keywords on React-related questions, namely,\ncode, link, vir, href, connect, azure, windows, and website. The error\nclassification of questions from the sample shows that algorithmic error is the\nmost frequent issue faced by all groups of users, where mid-reputation users\ncontribute the most, accounting for 55.77%. This suggests the need for the\ncommunity to provide guidance materials in solving algorithm-related problems.\nWe expect that the results of this study will provide valuable insight into\nfuture research to support the React community during the early stages of\nimplementation, facilitating their ability to effectively overcome challenges\nto adoption."}

Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source\ntext-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12\nbillion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises\nconcerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability.\n  Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the\nenvironment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to\nenhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models.\n  Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters\nand prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated\nimages while also lowering the energy consumption required for image\ngeneration. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to\nthat of the original SD model.\n  Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion,\ntesting it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our\nresults demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%,\nethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and\nGPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are\nconsistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts.\n  Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social\nand environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible\nwithout fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture."}

The article aims to make a reasoned\nchoice of the approach to modelling the battery discharge of a CubeSat\nsatellite. Modelling the battery discharge of a satellite will enable the\nprediction of the consequences of disconnecting the autonomous power system and\nensure the fault tolerance of equipment in orbit. Therefore, the selected study\nis relevant and promising. This study focuses on the analysis of CubeSat\nsatellite data, based explicitly on orbital data samples of the power system,\nwhich include data available at the time of the article publication. The\ndataset contains data on the voltage, current, and temperature of the battery\nand solar panels attached to the five sides of the satellite. In this context,\ntwo approaches are considered: analytical modelling based on physical laws and\nmachine learning, which uses empirical data to create a predictive model.\nResults: A comparative analysis of the modeling results reveals that the\nequivalent circuit approach has the advantage of transparency, as it identifies\npossible parameters that facilitate understanding of the relationships.\nHowever, the model is less flexible to environmental changes or non-standard\nsatellite behavior. The machine learning model demonstrated more accurate\nresults, as it can account for complex dependencies and adapt to actual\nconditions, even when they deviate from theoretical assumptions."}

Traditional static analysis tools often rely\non symbolic workflows, which restrict their coverage and hinder adaptability to\ncustomized bugs with diverse anti-patterns. While recent advances incorporate\nlarge language models (LLMs) to enhance bug detection, these methods continue\nto struggle with sophisticated bugs and typically operate within limited\nanalysis contexts. To address these challenges, we propose BugScope, an\nLLM-driven multi-agent system that emulates how human auditors learn new bug\npatterns from representative examples and apply that knowledge during code\nauditing. Given a set of examples illustrating both buggy and non-buggy\nbehaviors, BugScope synthesizes a retrieval strategy to extract relevant\ndetection contexts via program slicing and then constructs a tailored detection\nprompt to guide accurate reasoning by the LLM. Our evaluation on a curated\ndataset of 40 real-world bugs drawn from 21 widely-used open-source projects\ndemonstrates that BugScope achieves 87.04% precision and 90.00% recall,\nsurpassing state-of-the-art industrial tools by 0.44 in F1 score.

If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to\ncomplement their own skills?\n  To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a\nprogram-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of\nproposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly\nassigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without,\nboth validating their answers through the proof tools.
