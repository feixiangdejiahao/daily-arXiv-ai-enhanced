We evaluated RVSG with\nseveral requirements and navigation routes in a simulator using the latest AMR\nfrom PAL Robotics.

To identify TPL reuse in projects, Software\nComposition Analysis (SCA) is employed, and two categories of SCA techniques\nare used based on how TPLs are introduced: clone-based SCA and\npackage-manager-based SCA (PM-based SCA). Although introducing TPLs by clones\nis prevalent in Java, no clone-based SCA tools are specially designed for Java.\nAlso, directly applying clone-based SCA techniques from other tools is\nproblematic. To fill this gap, we introduce JC-Finder, a novel clone-based SCA\ntool that aims to accurately and comprehensively identify instances of TPL\nreuse introduced by source code clones in Java projects. JC-Finder achieves\nboth accuracy and efficiency in identifying TPL reuse from code cloning by\ncapturing features at the class level, maintaining inter-function\nrelationships, and excluding trivial or duplicated elements. To evaluate the\nefficiency of JC-Finder, we applied it to 9,965 most popular Maven libraries as\nreference data and tested the TPL reuse of 1,000 GitHub projects.

The software of such\nrobots often undergoes upgrades, for example, to add new functionalities, fix\nbugs, or delete obsolete functionalities. As a result, regression testing of\nrobot software becomes necessary. However, determining the expected correct\nbehavior of robots (i.e., a test oracle) is challenging due to the potentially\nunknown environments in which the robots must operate. To address this\nchallenge, machine learning (ML)-based test oracles present a viable solution.\nThis paper reports on the development of a test oracle to support regression\ntesting of autonomous mobile robots built by PAL Robotics (Spain), using\nquantum machine learning (QML), which enables faster training and the\nconstruction of more precise test oracles. Specifically, we propose a hybrid\nframework, QuReBot, that combines both quantum reservoir computing (QRC) and a\nsimple neural network, inspired by residual connection, to predict the expected\nbehavior of a robot. Results show that QRC alone fails to converge in our case,\nyielding high prediction error. In contrast, QuReBot converges and achieves 15%\nreduction of prediction error compared to the classical neural network\nbaseline. Finally, we further examine QuReBot under different configurations\nand offer practical guidance on optimal settings to support future robot\nsoftware testing."}

It assists developers by suggesting\nrelevant identifiers and APIs during coding. While completions are typically\nderived from static analysis, their usefulness depends heavily on how they are\nranked, as correct predictions buried deep in the list are rarely seen by\nusers. Most current systems rely on hand-crafted heuristics or lightweight\nmachine learning models trained on user logs, which can be further improved to\ncapture context information and generalize across projects and coding styles.\nIn this work, we propose a new scoring approach to ranking static completions\nusing language models in a lightweight and model-agnostic way. Our method\norganizes all valid completions into a prefix tree and performs a single greedy\ndecoding pass to collect token-level scores across the tree. This enables a\nprecise token-aware ranking without needing beam search, prompt engineering, or\nmodel adaptations. The approach is fast, architecture-agnostic, and compatible\nwith already deployed models for code completion.
