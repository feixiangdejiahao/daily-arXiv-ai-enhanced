Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability\nto clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes\nsevere) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code\nstructure. There is thus a need for research to develop and assess\ncomprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools. This study addresses this\nresearch gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of\nconcept. Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube\nviolations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack\nOverflow. Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it\nintroduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code\nfunctional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and\ndegraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework.

However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces\npractical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference\nlatency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and\nacceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge\nfrom large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient\ninference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this\ntechnique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and\ncomputer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains\nlargely underexplored.\n  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of\nKD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD\nmethods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across\neight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three\ndownstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers\nnotable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared\nwith standard fine-tuning.

This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading\nindustry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the\nFill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct\na diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with\nheuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus\nwith cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call\ngraphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both\nfile-level and repository-level scenarios.

However, in exchange for\nergonomics, big-step semantics give up power: Small-step semantics describes\nprogram behaviors that are outside the grasp of big-step semantics, notably\ndivergence. This work presents a little-known extension of big-step semantics\nwith inductive definitions that captures diverging computations without\nintroducing error states. This big-stop semantics is illustrated for typed,\nuntyped, and effectful variants of PCF, as well as a while-loop-based\nimperative language.
