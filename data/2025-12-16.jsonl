VC can be leveraged for rapid prototyping or developing the Minimum Viable Products (MVPs); however, it may introduce several risks throughout the software development life cycle. Based on our experience from several internally developed MVPs and a review of recent industry reports, this article analyzes the flow-debt tradeoffs associated with VC. The flow-debt trade-off arises when the seamless code generation occurs, leading to the accumulation of technical debt through architectural inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities, and increased maintenance overhead. These issues originate from process-level weaknesses, biases in model training data, a lack of explicit design rationale, and a tendency to prioritize quick code generation over human-driven iterative development. Based on our experiences, we identify and explain how current model, platform, and hardware limitations contribute to these issues, and propose countermeasures to address them, informing research and practice towards more sustainable VC approaches."}

Despite their popularity, major security concerns arise during container development and deployment. Software Engineering (SE) research literature reveals a lack of reviewed, aggregated, and organized knowledge of risks, vulnerabilities, security practices, and tools in container-based systems development and deployment. Therefore, we conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) based on 129 selected primary studies to explore and organize existing knowledge on security issues in software container systems. Data from the primary studies enabled us to identify critical risks and vulnerabilities across the container life-cycle and categorize them using a novel taxonomy. Additionally, the findings highlight the causes and implications and provide a list of mitigation techniques to overcome these risks and vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we provide an aggregation of security practices and tools that can help support and improve the overall security of container systems. This study offers critical insights into the current landscape of security issues within software container systems. Our analysis highlights the need for future SE research to focus on security enhancement practices that strengthen container systems and develop effective mitigation strategies to comprehensively address existing risks and vulnerabilities."}

Model selection is often performed in an ad hoc manner, relying on fragmented metadata and individual expertise, which can undermine reproducibility, transparency, and overall research software quality.\n  This work proposes a structured and evidence-driven approach to support AI model selection that aligns with both technical and contextual requirements. We conceptualize AI model selection as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem and introduce an evidence-based decision-support framework that integrates automated data collection pipelines, a structured knowledge graph, and MCDM principles. Following the Design Science Research methodology, the proposed framework (ModelSelect) is empirically validated through 50 real-world case studies and comparative experiments against leading generative AI systems.\n  The evaluation results show that ModelSelect produces reliable, interpretable, and reproducible recommendations that closely align with expert reasoning. Across the case studies, the framework achieved high coverage and strong rationale alignment in both model and library recommendation tasks, performing comparably to generative AI assistants while offering superior traceability and consistency.\n  By framing AI model selection as an MCDM problem, this work establishes a rigorous foundation for transparent and reproducible decision support in research software engineering. The proposed framework provides a scalable and explainable pathway for integrating empirical evidence into AI model recommendation processes, ultimately improving the quality and robustness of research software decision-making."}

However, despite recent advances on model checking hyperproperties, there is still a lack of higher-level specification languages that can effectively support software engineering practitioners in verifying properties of this class at early stages of system design.\n  Alloy is a lightweight formal method with a high-level specification language that is supported by automated analysis procedures, making it particularly well-suited for the verification of design models at early development stages. It does not natively support, however, the verification of hyperproperties.\n  This work proposes HyperPardinus, a new model finding procedure that extends Pardinus -- the temporal logic backend of the Alloy language -- to automatically verify hyperproperties over relational models by relying on existing low-level model checkers for hyperproperties. It then conservatively extends Alloy to support the specification and automatic verification of hyperproperties over design models, as well as the visualization of (counter-)examples at a higher-level of abstraction. Evaluation shows that our approach enables modeling and finding (counter-)examples for complex hyperproperties with alternating quantifiers, making it feasible to address relevant scenarios from the state of the art."}

Yet, despite these benefits, practitioners often skip modeling because it is time-consuming and demands scarce expertise. We address this barrier by investigating whether open-weight large language models, adapted via instruction tuning, can generate high-quality BPMN process models directly from natural language descriptions in a cost-effective and privacy-preserving way. We introduce InstruBPM, a reproducible approach that prepares paired text-diagram data and instruction tunes an open source large language model with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and quantization for on-prem deployment. We evaluate the tuned model through complementary perspectives: (i) text/code similarity using BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR, (ii) structural fidelity using Relative Graph Edit Distance, (iii) guidelines conformance using external tool checks, and (iv) a small expert review. Using a curated subset of a multi-domain BPMN dataset, we compare the tuned model with untuned open-weight baselines and strong proprietary models under consistent prompting regimes. Our compact tuned model outperforms all baselines across sequence and structural metrics while requiring substantially fewer resources; guideline analysis and expert feedback further indicate that the generated diagrams largely follow BPMN best practices and are useful starting points that reduce modeling effort. Overall, instruction tuning improves structural accuracy and robustness compared to untuned baselines and reduces reliance on heavy prompt scaffolding. We publicly share the trained models and scripts to support reproducibility and further research."}

However, LLM hallucination, generating plausible but factually incorrect citations to source code, remains a critical barrier to reliable developer assistance. This paper addresses the challenges of achieving verifiable, citation grounded code comprehension through hybrid retrieval and lightweight structural reasoning. Our work is grounded in systematic evaluation across 30 Python repositories with 180 developer queries, comparing retrieval modalities, graph expansion strategies, and citation verification mechanisms. We find that challenges of citation accuracy arise from the interplay between sparse lexical matching, dense semantic similarity, and cross file architectural dependencies. Among these, cross file evidence discovery is the largest contributor to citation completeness, but it is largely overlooked because existing systems rely on pure textual similarity without leveraging code structure. We advocate for citation grounded generation as an architectural principle for code comprehension systems and demonstrate this need by achieving 92 percent citation accuracy with zero hallucinations. Specifically, we develop a hybrid retrieval system combining BM25 sparse matching, BGE dense embeddings, and Neo4j graph expansion via import relationships, which outperforms single mode baselines by 14 to 18 percentage points while discovering cross file evidence missed by pure text similarity in 62 percent of architectural queries."}

These approaches face two key limitations: (1) their reliance on pre-existing GitHub repositories offers limited flexibility, and (2) their primary focus on issue resolution tasks restricts their applicability to the much wider variety of tasks a software engineer must handle. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SWE-Playground, a novel pipeline for generating environments and trajectories which supports the training of versatile coding agents. Unlike prior efforts, SWE-Playground synthetically generates projects and tasks from scratch with strong language models and agents, eliminating reliance on external data sources. This allows us to tackle a much wider variety of coding tasks, such as reproducing issues by generating unit tests and implementing libraries from scratch. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on three distinct benchmarks, and results indicate that SWE-Playground produces trajectories with dense training signal, enabling agents to reach comparable performance with significantly fewer trajectories than previous works."}

Existing anonymization methods, such as tabular transformations and graph perturbations, often overlook contextual dependencies among software metrics, leading to suboptimal privacy-utility tradeoffs. Leveraging the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a cluster-guided anonymization technique that preserves contextual and statistical relationships within JIT datasets. Our method groups commits into feature-based clusters and employs an LLM to generate context-aware parameter configurations for each commit cluster, defining alpha-beta ratios and churn mixture distributions used for anonymization. Our evaluation on six projects (Cassandra, Flink, Groovy, Ignite, OpenStack, and Qt) shows that our LLM-based approach achieves privacy level 2 (IPR >= 80 percent), improving privacy by 18 to 25 percent over four state-of-the-art graph-based anonymization baselines while maintaining comparable F1 scores. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can act as adaptive anonymization engines when provided with cluster-specific statistical information about similar data points, enabling context-sensitive and privacy-preserving software analytics without compromising predictive accuracy."}

We revisit a trace-discovered connectivity model that derives a service dependency graph from traces and uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate endpoint availability under fail-stop service failures. Compared to earlier work, we (i) derive the graph directly from raw OpenTelemetry traces, (ii) attach endpoint-specific success predicates, and (iii) add a simple asynchronous semantics that treats Kafka edges as non-blocking for immediate HTTP success. We apply this model to the OpenTelemetry Demo (\"Astronomy Shop\") using a GitHub Actions workflow that discovers the graph, runs simulations, and executes chaos experiments that randomly kill microservices in a Docker Compose deployment. Across the studied failure fractions, the model reproduces the overall availability degradation curve, while asynchronous semantics for Kafka edges change predicted availabilities by at most about 10^(-5) (0.001 percentage points). This null result suggests that for immediate HTTP availability in this case study, explicitly modeling asynchronous dependencies is not warranted, and a simpler connectivity-only model is sufficient."}

As systems grow in complexity, there is a pressing need for more scalable and efficient testing methodologies. This systematic literature review examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping penetration testing, analyzing 58 peer-reviewed studies from major academic databases. Our findings reveal that while AI-assisted pentesting is still in its early stages, notable progress is underway, particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL), which was the focus of 77% of the reviewed works. Most research centers on the discovery and exploitation phases of pentesting, where AI shows the greatest promise in automating repetitive tasks, optimizing attack strategies, and improving vulnerability identification. Real-world applications remain limited but encouraging, including the European Space Agency's PenBox and various open-source tools. These demonstrate AI's potential to streamline attack path analysis, analyze complex network topology, and reduce manual workload. However, challenges persist: current models often lack flexibility and are underdeveloped for the reconnaissance and post-exploitation phases of pentesting. Applications involving Large Language Models (LLMs) remain relatively under-researched, pointing to a promising direction for future exploration. This paper offers a critical overview of AI's current and potential role in penetration testing, providing valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and organizations aiming to enhance security assessments through advanced automation or looking for gaps in existing research."}

While machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, their effectiveness is limited by the way they interpret data.

This limitation is especially pronounced for C and C++, where flatter syntactic hierarchies, pointer aliasing, multi-level indirection, typedef-based type obfuscation, and function-pointer calls hinder accurate static analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ATLAS, a Python-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) that (i) generates statement-level Control Flow Graphs (CFG) and type-aware Data Flow Graphs (DFG) that capture inter-functional dependencies for the entire program; (ii) has the ability to work on entire C and C++ projects comprising multiple files; (iii) works on both compilable and non-compilable code and (iv) produces a unified multi-view code representation using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), CFG and DFG.

We address this gap by introducing code-aligned use case benchmarks, constructed through manual validation of both user-goal and subfunction use cases across nine real-world software projects. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first systematic study of LLMs and propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol that assesses actor correctness, name accuracy, path fidelity, and behavioral coverage. The results show that while LLMs can partially reconstruct system functionality, their performance varies significantly across projects, with particularly noticeable shortcomings in domain-specific and multi-module systems. The models also exhibit high omission rates and struggle to maintain consistent abstraction when aggregating subfunctions into user-goal use cases, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of LLM-based use case reverse engineering."}

The fault detection effectiveness of MT is influenced not only by the choice and quality of MRs, but also by how source test cases and metamorphic groups (MGs) are selected. While substantial research has focused on designing, generating, and validating MRs, systematic methods for source test case selection and MG selection remain largely unexplored. Although the Proportional Sampling Strategy (PSS) provides strong theoretical guarantees in traditional testing, its assumptions cannot be directly applied in MT due to differences in selection domains, test units, and failure distributions. This paper proposes PSALM, an adaptation of PSS to MT for both source test case selection and MG selection. We formally prove that PSALM is never inferior to random selection regardless of how the source test case and MG domains are partitioned. We further identify the conditions under which applying PSALM to source test case selection and MG selection yields identical effectiveness. A comprehensive empirical study on eight subject programs and 184 mutants shows that the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and that PSALM generally performs more effectively than existing selection strategies such as ART and MT-ART. These results demonstrate that PSALM provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective selection strategy for MT."}

These characteristics make it especially challenging to monitor the execution of quantum circuits, complicating essential tasks such as debugging and runtime monitoring. This paper presents QMON, a practical methodology that leverages mid-circuit measurements and reset operations to monitor the internal states of quantum circuits while preserving their original runtime behavior. QMON enables the instrumentation of monitoring operators at developer-specified locations within the circuit, allowing comparisons between expected and observed quantum-state probabilities at those locations. We evaluated QMON by analyzing its impact on circuit behavior, monitoring coverage, and effectiveness in bug localization. Experimental results involving 154 quantum circuits show that all circuits preserve their intended functionality after instrumentation and that QMON successfully detects and localizes various programming errors. Although monitoring coverage is limited by the need to preserve delicate quantum properties, such as entanglement, QMON effectively detects errors while introducing no or negligible disturbance to the original quantum states. QMON facilitates the development of more robust and reliable quantum software as the field continues to mature."}

Our motivating study reveals that inefficient UI representation creates a critical performance bottleneck. However, UI representation optimization, formulated as the task of automatically generating programs that transform UI representations, faces two unique challenges. First, the lack of Boolean oracles, which traditional program synthesis uses to decisively validate semantic correctness, poses a fundamental challenge to co-optimization of token efficiency and completeness. Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task. First, UIFormer restricts the program space using a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures UI-specific operations. Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance. Real-world industry deployment at WeChat further validates the practical impact of UIFormer."}

Existing work in requirements engineering (RE) has explored how requirements for AI systems and their data can be represented. However, related interviews with industry professionals show that data annotations and their related requirements introduce distinct challenges, indicating a need for annotation-specific requirement representations. We propose the Data Annotation Requirements Representation and Specification (DARS), including an Annotation Negotiation Card to align stakeholders on objectives and constraints, and a Scenario-Based Annotation Specification to express atomic and verifiable data annotation requirements. We evaluate DARS with an automotive perception case related to an ongoing project, and a mapping against 18 real-world data annotation error types. The results suggest that DARS mitigates root causes of completeness, accuracy, and consistency annotation errors. By integrating DARS into RE, this work improves the reliability of safety-critical systems using data annotations and demonstrates how engineering frameworks must evolve for data-dependent components of today's intelligent information systems."}

At the European Union level, regulatory measures such as the CSRD and the CSDD impose obligations on companies, including those within the ICT sector, to recognize and mitigate their environmental footprint. This study provides a comprehensive system mapping aimed at enhancing the awareness and understanding of software-related emissions and the corresponding responsibilities borne by the ICT sector.

The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency."}

The Data-Light SE Challenge", "comment": null, "summary": "Much of software engineering (SE) research assumes that progress depends on massive datasets and CPU-intensive optimizers. Yet has this assumption been rigorously tested?\n  The counter-evidence presented in this paper suggests otherwise: across dozens of optimization problems from recent SE literature, including software configuration and performance tuning, cloud and systems optimization, project and process-level decision modeling, behavioral analytics, financial risk modeling, project health prediction, reinforcement learning tasks, sales forecasting, and software testing, even with just a few dozen labels, very simple methods (e.g. diversity sampling, a minimal Bayesian learner, or random probes) achieve near 90% of the best reported results. Further, these simple methods perform just as well as more state-of-the-the-art optimizers like SMAC, TPE, DEHB etc. While some tasks would require better outcomes and more sampling, these results seen after a few dozen samples would suffice for many engineering needs (particularly when the goal is rapid and cost-efficient guidance rather than slow and exhaustive optimization).\n  Our results highlight that some SE tasks may be better served by lightweight approaches that demand fewer labels and far less computation. We hence propose the data-light challenge: when will a handful of labels suffice for SE tasks? To enable a large-scale investigation of this issue, we contribute (1) a mathematical formalization of labeling, (2) lightweight baseline algorithms, and (3) results on public-domain data showing the conditions under which lightweight methods excel or fail.\n  For the purposes of open science, our scripts and data are online at https://github.com/KKGanguly/NEO ."}
