While\nexisting paradigms often rely on either greedy exploitation (i.e., iterative\nrefinement) or stochastic exploration (i.e., relying on sample-based voting or\nreranking mechanisms), the balance between these two dimensions remains\nunderexplored. To investigate the LLM's intrinsic ability to balance\nexploitation and exploration, we introduce SELF-REDRAFT, a framework built upon\nSelf-Refine that encourages the model to propose new drafts for solutions that\nare fundamentally flawed. Our results show that SELF-REDRAFT consistently\nachieves better performance than Self-Refine when converged under the same\nmaximum number of iterations. Still, we observe that significant room for\nimprovement remains, largely due to two core aspects of current self-redraft\ncapabilities: constrained capacity for generating instructive feedback and\nfragile discriminative judgment. We also find that balancing strategies vary\nnotably across different LLMs, reflecting distinct, model-specific behaviors.\nOverall, our study establishes a baseline for intrinsic\nexploration-exploitation balancing in test-time scaling and identifies feedback\nand discrimination as key areas with potential for future advances."}

Differential fuzzing, in\nparticular, operates as a guided randomized search, aiming to find (similar)\ninputs that lead to a maximum difference in software outputs or their\nbehaviors. However, fuzzing, as a dynamic analysis, lacks any guarantees on the\nabsence of bugs: from a differential fuzzing campaign that has observed no bugs\n(or a minimal difference), what is the risk of observing a bug (or a larger\ndifference) if we run the fuzzer for one or more steps?\n  This paper investigates the application of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to\naddress the risk of missing or underestimating bugs in differential fuzzing.\nThe key observation is that differential fuzzing as a random process resembles\nthe maximum distribution of observed differences. Hence, EVT, a branch of\nstatistics dealing with extreme values, is an ideal framework to analyze the\ntail of the differential fuzzing campaign to contain the risk. We perform\nexperiments on a set of real-world Java libraries and use differential fuzzing\nto find information leaks via side channels in these libraries.

Since SPLs can encompass very\nlarge numbers of products, developing a rigorous AC for each product\nindividually is infeasible.

RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning,\nexecuting, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection\nand tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java\nprojects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a\nsearch-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings.

This limitation is\nevident in open-world software environments, where emerging challenges\ntranscend established paradigms.\n  We propose U2F (Unknown Unknowns to Functional solutions), a\ncognitive-inspired, uncertainty-embracing multi-agent framework that\nsystematically surfaces \"Unknown Unknowns\" - novel solution pathways absent\nfrom initial formulations but holding innovative potential. U2F consists of two\nkey components: (1) a Discovery-Exploration-Integration agent system for\nuncovering and synthesizing potential solutions, and (2) cognitive enhancement\nmechanisms across three dimensions: cross-domain analogical reasoning, reverse\nthinking, and external validation, which strategically reframe and extend\nconventional solution boundaries.\n  Applied to 218 real-world software enabler stories curated from authentic\nengineering tasks, U2F achieved notable improvements: human experts reported a\n14 percent increase in overall novelty, 51 percent improvement in semantic\nnovelty, and stable feasibility (4.02/5.0), corroborated by an LLM-based\nevaluator. These results highlight the potential of embracing uncertainty as a\ncatalyst for innovation in software engineering."}

While large language models (LLMs)\nhave shown promise in generating code explanations, they often lack grounding\nin the broader software engineering context. We propose a novel approach that\nleverages natural language artifacts from GitHub -- such as pull request\ndescriptions, issue descriptions and discussions, and commit messages -- to\nenhance LLM-based code understanding. Our system consists of three components:\none that extracts and structures relevant GitHub context, another that uses\nthis context to generate high-level explanations of the code's purpose, and a\nthird that validates the explanation. We implemented this as a standalone tool,\nas well as a server within the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling\nintegration with other AI-assisted development tools. Our main use case is that\nof enhancing a standard LLM-based code explanation with code insights that our\nsystem generates. To evaluate explanations' quality, we conducted a small scale\nuser study, with developers of several open projects, as well as developers of\nproprietary projects. Our user study indicates that when insights are generated\nthey often are helpful and non trivial, and are free from hallucinations."}

In this paper, we present the OpenHands Software Agent\nSDK, a toolkit for implementing software development agents that satisfy these\ndesiderata. This toolkit is a complete architectural redesign of the agent\ncomponents of the popular OpenHands framework for software development agents,\nwhich has 64k+ GitHub stars. To achieve flexibility, we design a simple\ninterface for implementing agents that requires only a few lines of code in the\ndefault case, but is easily extensible to more complex, full-featured agents\nwith features such as custom tools, memory management, and more. For security\nand reliability, it delivers seamless local-to-remote execution portability,\nintegrated REST/WebSocket services. For interaction with human users, it can\nconnect directly to a variety of interfaces, such as visual workspaces (VS\nCode, VNC, browser), command-line interfaces, and APIs. Compared with existing\nSDKs from OpenAI, Claude, and Google, OpenHands uniquely integrates native\nsandboxed execution, lifecycle control, model-agnostic multi-LLM routing, and\nbuilt-in security analysis. Empirical results on SWE-Bench Verified and GAIA\nbenchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Put together, these elements allow\nthe OpenHands Software Agent SDK to provide a practical foundation for\nprototyping, unlocking new classes of custom applications, and reliably\ndeploying agents at scale."}
